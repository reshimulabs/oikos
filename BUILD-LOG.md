## 2026-03-05 — Project Initialization & Strategic Assessment

### Session: Initial Analysis & Scope Definition

**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### What Was Done

1. **Prompt Analysis**
   - Read and analyzed the 13-page bootstrap prompt (`CLAUDE CODE PROMPT v4 FINAL.pdf`)
   - Original prompt targeted Track 4 (Tipping Bot) with Rumble integration
   - Architecture: dual-process (Wallet Isolate on Bare + Agent Brain on Node.js)

2. **Hackathon Research**
   - Scraped full hackathon detail page: https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/hackathon-galactica-wdk-2026-01/detail
   - Identified 4 tracks + Best Overall prize
   - Extracted all judging criteria, requirements, submission guidelines
   - Key finding: **Bare Runtime and Pear Runtime are NOT mentioned** on the hackathon page, but Bare is Tether's own runtime (strategic advantage)

3. **OpenClaw Research**
   - Confirmed: 250k+ GitHub stars, MIT license, npm package `openclaw`
   - Architecture: gateway, brain (ReAct loop), memory, skills, heartbeat
   - Skills are folders with `SKILL.md` files (YAML frontmatter + markdown)
   - Native Ollama integration for local LLMs
   - Requires Node.js >= 22

4. **Local LLM Research (Sovereign AI)**
   - Compared: Ollama, node-llama-cpp, LM Studio
   - Decision: **Ollama + Qwen 3 8B (Q4_K_M)** for hackathon
   - Reasoning: one-command setup, OpenAI-compatible API, trivial cloud swap
   - Alternative for production: node-llama-cpp (in-process, grammar-constrained JSON)

5. **Tzimtzum v2 Analysis**
   - Explored `/Users/adrianosousa/tzimtzum_v2` — P2P sovereign publishing platform on Pear Runtime
   - Already has WDK Spark wallet running on Bare with patches
   - Two-process architecture (Bare + Electron) mirrors our design
   - Key reusable assets: `scripts/patch-wdk.js`, IPC patterns, wallet lifecycle management

6. **Testnet Faucet Research**
   - Sepolia ETH: Google Cloud Faucet, Alchemy, QuickNode, Chainlink
   - Bitcoin testnet: bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net, Tatum, CoinFaucet.eu, Testnet.help

7. **Strategic Reframing**
   - Changed primary track from Track 4 (Tipping Bot) to **Track 1 (Agent Wallets)**
   - Rationale: broader scope, higher prize potential, better architecture fit
   - Rumble tipping becomes an optional feature, not the product
   - Event source design is now platform-agnostic

8. **Project Identity**
   - Named: **SovClaw** (Sovereign + OpenClaw)
   - Positioned as a reusable primitive: OpenClaw skill + Pear-native wallet isolate

#### Files Created

| File | Purpose | Lines |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Security constitution — loaded every session, governs all code decisions | ~180 |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Living implementation plan with phases, criteria, risks, decisions | ~220 |
| `BUILD-LOG.md` | This file — append-only record of everything built | — |

#### Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Track 1 (Agent Wallets) as primary target | Broader than Track 4, aligns with architecture, higher prize potential |
| Sovereign AI first (Ollama + Qwen 3 8B) | Zero cloud dependency, aligns with hackathon thesis |
| Build on Bare/Pear Runtime | Tether's own stack, proven by Tzimtzum, strategic judge alignment |
| Platform-agnostic event source | Not locked to Rumble, extensible to any event stream |
| Project name: SovClaw | Clear identity combining Sovereign + OpenClaw |

#### Open Questions for Next Session

- [x] Confirm Bare Runtime is installed and working → **v1.28.0**
- [x] Confirm Ollama is installed and Qwen 3 8B is pulled → **Installed, model downloading**
- [x] Confirm Node.js >= 22 is available → **v24.13.0**
- [x] Review Tzimtzum's `patch-wdk.js` for reusability → **Reviewed, will adapt for EVM/BTC modules**
- [x] Decide on monorepo tooling → **npm workspaces**

#### Remaining for Phase 1

- [x] Verify wallet-isolate runs on Bare Runtime → **DONE. Created compat layers (fs.ts, process.ts). Runs on Bare v1.28.0.**
- [x] WDK Bare compatibility patches → **DONE. Used bare-fs + bare-process imports via compat layer.**

---

## 2026-03-05 — Phase 2: Agent Brain + Bare Runtime Verification

### Session: Full Agent Brain Build + End-to-End Verification

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### What Was Done

1. **Bare Runtime Compatibility**
   - Discovered `import * as fs from 'fs'` fails on Bare → created `src/compat/fs.ts` (tries `bare-fs` first, falls back to Node.js `fs`)
   - Discovered `process` is not a global in Bare → created `src/compat/process.ts` (checks `globalThis.process` then imports `bare-process`)
   - Added type declarations for `bare-fs` and `bare-process`
   - Changed all `process.*` references in `main.ts` to `proc.*`
   - Fixed compiled dist path: output at `dist/src/main.js` (not `dist/main.js`) due to `rootDir: "."` in tsconfig

2. **BigInt Serialization Bug**
   - `PolicyEngine.getStatus()` passed raw BigInt values from `sessionTotalBySymbol` Map
   - JSON.stringify cannot serialize BigInt → crash on IPC response
   - Fixed by explicitly converting BigInt to string with `.toString()` in `getStatus()`

3. **Agent Brain Implementation** (full build)
   - IPC client (`ipc/client.ts`) — spawns wallet-isolate, correlated JSON-lines, 30s timeout
   - LLM client (`llm/client.ts`) — OpenAI SDK configured for Ollama, structured JSON response
   - LLM mock (`llm/mock.ts`) — 5 pre-scripted decisions cycling through strategies
   - Event types + mock (`events/types.ts`, `events/mock.ts`) — platform-agnostic events, 3-min simulated timeline
   - Brain core (`agent/brain.ts`) — events → LLM reasoning → PaymentProposal → IPC
   - Prompts (`agent/prompts.ts`) — system + event prompt builders
   - Config (`config/env.ts`) — environment loading with defaults
   - Dashboard (`dashboard/server.ts`) — Express on localhost:3420, 6 REST endpoints
   - Dashboard UI (`dashboard/public/index.html`) — dark-themed monitoring with 2s polling
   - Creator registry (`creators/registry.ts`) — demo creator addresses
   - Main entry (`main.ts`) — boot sequence: config → wallet → LLM → brain → events → dashboard
   - Demo script (`scripts/start-demo.sh`) — one-command mock mode boot

4. **End-to-End Verification**
   - Tested full pipeline on Node.js: events → reasoning → payment proposal → policy check → cooldown rejection → audit
   - Tested wallet-isolate on Bare Runtime: processes IPC messages correctly
   - Fixed TypeScript double-cast issue: `e.data as unknown as Record<string, unknown>`

5. **OpenClaw Skill Definition**
   - Created `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
   - Note: OpenClaw is a standalone gateway service, NOT an embeddable library
   - We use OpenAI SDK directly for LLM, skill definition for composability

#### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `wallet-isolate/src/compat/fs.ts` | Runtime-agnostic filesystem (bare-fs / node:fs) |
| `wallet-isolate/src/compat/process.ts` | Runtime-agnostic process (bare-process / globalThis) |

## 2026-03-05 — SCOPE ELEVATION: Easy → Legend

### Session: Hackathon Research + Strategic Pivot

**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### Trigger

Adriano shared a screenshot of the DoraHacks Builder Hub project idea tiers and asked: **"Are we still on the tipping bot???? Weren't we aiming at a different scope, on pear runtime?"**

The Builder Hub categorizes project ideas into tiers:
- **Easy** (green): Tip bot, portfolio tracker, QR payments, expense logger
- **Medium** (yellow): Bill splitter, escrow, DCA bot, multi-sig
- **Hard** (red): Yield optimizer, arbitrage, cross-chain, portfolio rebalancer
- **Legend** (purple): Cross-chain bridge via NL, Agent-to-agent marketplace, Self-sustaining agent, Multi-agent trading swarm, DAO treasury manager, ZK privacy, AI-only governance

**Our original scope mapped to Easy ("Tip bot for social media creators")** — the lowest tier.
Our architecture was already Legend-grade. The use case needed to match.

#### Hackathon Page Deep Analysis

Scraped and analyzed all hackathon pages via Chrome MCP:
- Detail page: https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/hackathon-galactica-wdk-2026-01/detail
- Tracks page: https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/hackathon-galactica-wdk-2026-01/tracks
- Builder Hub: https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/hackathon-galactica-wdk-2026-01/builder-hub

**Critical findings:**

1. **Technical Must-Haves** (non-negotiable for ALL tracks):
   - Use WDK for wallet operations (self-custodial) ✅
   - Integrate with OpenClaw or a similar agent framework ⚠️ (need OpenClaw Skill + MCP Server)
   - **Use Tether tokens (USDt/XAUt/USAt)** ❌ (we only had USDT + XAUT, missing USAt)
   - Clear README ❌ (not written yet)

2. **What Judges Look For** (from Submission Tips):
   - Innovation: Novel use of AI + crypto
   - Technical Execution: Clean code, proper error handling
   - User Experience: Seamless, intuitive interactions
   - **Completeness: Working demo > half-finished features** — CRITICAL constraint on scope

3. **USAt (USAT) Research**:
   - Tether's federally regulated US stablecoin, launched January 27, 2026
   - Backed 1:1 by US Treasury Bills via Anchorage Digital Bank
   - Issued under the GENIUS Act framework
   - Launched during this hackathon cycle — supporting it shows we're current

4. **Track 1 (Agent Wallets) Detailed Requirements**:
   - MUST: Agents hold/send/manage USDt, USAt, XAUt autonomously
   - NICE: Clear separation between agent logic and wallet execution ✅
   - NICE: Emphasis on safety (permissions, limits, recovery) ✅
   - BONUS: Composability with other agents ❌
   - BONUS: Open-source LLM ✅

#### Reference Repository Analysis

Explored Adriano's two other projects for reusable patterns:

**`/adrianosousa/rgb-c-t`** (rgb-consignment-transport):
- 1,541 lines of Hyperswarm P2P transport code, all Bare-compatible
- Session management with state machine (675 lines) — DIRECTLY reusable for agent-to-agent connections
- Topic derivation via BLAKE2b KDF (118 lines) — reusable for swarm discovery
- Peer authentication via Noise pubkey verification (97 lines) — reusable for agent identity
- ACK/NACK signaling protocol (230 lines) — reusable for payment confirmation
- Binary framing with headers (351 lines) — adaptable for agent messages
- Uses same crypto stack: sodium-universal, b4a, compact-encoding, protomux
- Pre-grant with RGB Protocol Association ($35K budget)
- Full protocol specification in `spec/protocol.md`

**`/adrianosousa/rgb-wallet-pear`** (Pear Desktop RGB Wallet):
- Production-grade Pear Runtime app architecture
- `index.js` main process with `bare-subprocess` child spawning — DIRECTLY reusable
- Bearer token session auth (32-byte random, CLI args) — reusable pattern
- Node.js sidecar with HTTP API (13 REST endpoints) — proven architecture
- DHT testnet for testing (`hyperdht/testnet`, 3 bootstrap nodes) — reusable for swarm demo
- Mock fallback pattern — same approach we use
- `RgbManager` orchestrator (883 lines) — pattern for wallet lifecycle management
- `pear.links` HTTP whitelisting for renderer fetch

#### Scope Elevation Decision

**FROM**: "Tip bot for social media creators" (Easy tier)
**TO**: "Multi-agent trading swarm + Self-sustaining agent" (Legend tier)

The product is no longer a tip bot. It's a **Sovereign Agent Wallet Protocol**:

1. **Wallet Protocol** (core) — process-isolated multi-chain wallet, already built
2. **Autonomous Agent** (reference) — LLM-powered brain, already built
3. **Agent Swarm** (legend) — multi-agent P2P trading on Hyperswarm, NEW
4. **Integration Layer** — OpenClaw Skill + MCP Server + Direct IPC, NEW

**Why Multi-Agent Trading Swarm?**
- Adriano's insight: "It's natural on Pear Runtime" — Hyperswarm is literally designed for this
- Directly reuses proven code from rgb-c-t (session management, auth, messaging)
- Directly reuses Pear patterns from rgb-wallet-pear (subprocess, auth, DHT testnet)
- Covers 2 Legend ideas (swarm + self-sustaining) in one architecture
- Shows "composability with other agents" (Track 1 bonus)
- Nobody else at the hackathon will have P2P agent swarms on Tether's own runtime

**Multi-asset mandatory:**
- USAt added alongside USDt and XAUt (hackathon Technical Must-Have)
- Agent reasons about portfolio allocation across the 3 Tether assets
- DeFi capabilities: swaps (USDt <-> XAUt <-> USAt), bridges (Ethereum <-> Arbitrum), yield
- All DeFi ops go through same PolicyEngine → Executor pipeline

**Key architectural decision: Hyperswarm in Brain, not Wallet**
- Wallet Isolate stays small (keys + policy + signing)
- Brain handles P2P (already has internet access for LLM)
- Brain negotiates with peers, sends PaymentProposals to own Wallet via IPC
- Wallet doesn't care where proposals come from — it just evaluates policy and signs

#### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Complete rewrite: 3-layer product, multi-asset, swarm protocol, DeFi, integration surfaces |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Complete rewrite: 6 phases, Legend targets, reference repo reuse plan, updated decision log |
| `BUILD-LOG.md` | This entry (append-only, as always) |

#### What's Next

Phase 3: Multi-asset + DeFi (add USAT, swap/bridge/yield proposals)
Phase 4: Agent Swarm (Hyperswarm discovery, negotiation, payment flows)
Phase 5: Pear Runtime packaging + OpenClaw/MCP integration
Phase 6: Polish, demo video, documentation, submission

## 2026-03-06 — Swarm Architecture Refinement: Room-Based Meta-Marketplace + Reputation

### Session: Product Vision Refinement

**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### Trigger

Adriano refined the swarm messaging concept with three critical insights:

1. **Privacy concern**: Broadcasting all transaction details on the swarm is a bad idea. It leaks negotiation context and harms privacy.
2. **Room-based model**: Instead of a flat broadcast swarm, use an announcement board → private rooms architecture. Agents post offers publicly (metadata only), then negotiate privately in E2E encrypted rooms.
3. **Meta-marketplace**: SovClaw shouldn't be ONE marketplace — it should be a platform where agents CREATE marketplaces for anything. The protocol is agnostic to what's being traded.
4. **Reputation from audit logs**: The append-only audit trail we already built is a natural source for trust scoring. Make it cryptographically verifiable.

#### Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Two-layer topic model** (board + rooms) | Privacy-preserving by design. Board = public metadata. Rooms = E2E encrypted negotiation. Rooms are ephemeral — destroyed after settlement. |
| **Meta-marketplace concept** | Protocol doesn't care what's traded. Digital services, DeFi, digital goods, financial services. Each marketplace = a set of rooms. Scalable because Hyperswarm scales. |
| **Audit-derived reputation** | Append-only audit log already exists. `reputation = f(successful_txs, failed_txs, total_volume, history_length, dispute_rate)`. Verified via Merkle proofs without exposing raw data. |
| **Sovereign trust** | No central reputation authority. Each agent derives and verifies reputation independently from cryptographic proofs. Consistent with overall sovereignty thesis. |
| **Privacy principles** | Board: metadata only. Rooms: E2E encrypted, ephemeral. Audit: shared as proofs, never raw. On-chain: public (blockchain nature). Negotiation WHY: private. |

#### Architecture: Two-Layer Topic Model

```
Board Topic (public):
  boardTopic = BLAKE2b-256(key="sovclaw-board-v0", msg=swarmId)
  - Announcements (offer type, price range, reputation score)
  - NO transaction details, NO negotiation content

Room Topics (private, per-offer):
  roomTopic = BLAKE2b-256(key="sovclaw-room-v0", msg=announcementId + creatorPubkey)
  - E2E encrypted via Noise_XX
  - Bidding, counteroffers, settlement details
  - Ephemeral — destroyed after settlement
```

#### Architecture: Protomux Channel Separation

```
Board channel:  Announcement, OfferListing, AuctionListing, ServiceRequest, ReputationProof
Room channel:   TaskBid, CounterOffer, TaskAccept, PaymentRequest, PaymentConfirm
Feed channel:   PriceFeed, StrategySignal, Heartbeat
```

#### Architecture: Reputation System

```
Agent Wallet Isolate:
  └── Append-only audit log (existing)
        └── Hash chain (Merkle tree) over entries
              └── Reputation score = f(metrics)
                    └── ReputationProof = Merkle proof + claimed score
                          └── Verifiable by any peer without seeing raw data
```

#### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Swarm Protocol section rewritten: two-layer topics, marketplace model, reputation system, privacy principles, updated flow diagram |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Phase 4 rewritten: 4.1 two-layer discovery, 4.3 multiplexed messaging, 4.4 meta-marketplace, 4.5 reputation system (new), updated exit criteria, new risks, 4 new decision log entries |
| `BUILD-LOG.md` | This entry |

#### What's Next

Continue with Phase 3 implementation (multi-asset + DeFi):
- Add USAT to TokenSymbol
- Implement swap/bridge/yield proposal types
- Extend policy engine for new proposal types
- Then Phase 4: build the room-based meta-marketplace on Hyperswarm

## 2026-03-06 — Official Judging Criteria Integration

### Session: Rules Analysis + Docs Alignment

**Duration**: ~15 min
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### What Was Done

Adriano shared the official hackathon rules and judging criteria. Our ROADMAP.md had placeholder criteria from the hackathon detail page — the official criteria are more specific and have **7 categories** (not the generic 4 we had).

#### Official Judging Criteria (verbatim from rules)

1. **Agent Intelligence** — Strong use of LLMs, autonomous agents, clear decision-making logic driving real actions.
2. **WDK Wallet Integration** — Secure, correct, non-custodial wallet with robust transaction handling.
3. **Technical Execution** — Quality of architecture, code, integrations, reliability of payment flows.
4. **Agentic Payment Design** — Realistic, programmable payment flows powered by agents (conditional payments, subscriptions, coordination, commerce logic).
5. **Originality** — Innovative use case and creative rethinking of agent-wallet interaction.
6. **Polish & Ship-ability** — Completeness, UX clarity (especially around permissions and transactions), readiness for real-world deployment.
7. **Presentation & Demo** — Clear explanation of agent logic, wallet flow, payment lifecycle, with a strong live demo.

#### Gap Analysis

| Criterion | Coverage | Action Needed |
|---|---|---|
| Agent Intelligence | ✅ Strong — LLM reasoning loop, multi-asset strategy, swarm negotiation | Make decision chain visible in dashboard |
| WDK Integration | ✅ Strongest pillar — process-isolated, 51 tests, policy engine | None |
| Technical Execution | ✅ Strong — strict TS, dual-process, IPC, audit trail | None |
| Agentic Payment Design | ✅ **This IS our product** — policy-enforced, room negotiation, escrow-like, DeFi flows | Lean into this in demo video |
| Originality | ✅ — P2P swarm on Tether's runtime, meta-marketplace, sovereign reputation | None |
| Polish & Ship-ability | ⚠️ — Dashboard exists but needs to clearly show permissions + tx lifecycle | Phase 6 dashboard polish is critical |
| Presentation & Demo | ⚠️ — Planned but not built. Must run "out of the box" per Rule 6 | One-command demo is non-negotiable |

**Key insight from criterion #4 (Agentic Payment Design)**: The judges are specifically looking for "conditional payments, subscriptions, coordination, commerce logic." Our PolicyEngine (conditional payments with budgets/cooldowns/whitelists) + room-based negotiation (coordination) + meta-marketplace (commerce logic) maps perfectly to this. This should be the centerpiece of our demo.

**Key insight from Rule 6**: "Make sure it can be accessed directly—such as through a web browser or by running it out of the box." The one-command demo script + localhost dashboard is our answer. Judges will NOT debug our setup.

#### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `ROADMAP.md` | Judging criteria table rewritten with official 7 categories, priority ratings, and detailed how-we-score mapping |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Hackathon Context rewritten with official judging criteria, key rules, submission requirements |
| `BUILD-LOG.md` | This entry |

#### Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **"Agentic Payment Design" is our hero criterion** | It's literally what we built: policy-enforced conditional payments + room negotiation + meta-marketplace. Demo should lead with this. |
| **Dashboard must show permission decisions clearly** | Criterion #6 explicitly calls out "UX clarity especially around permissions and transactions." PolicyEngine reasoning must be front and center. |
| **One-command demo is non-negotiable** | Rule 6: "accessed directly—through a web browser or by running it out of the box." No setup friction for judges. |

## 2026-03-06 — x402 Machine Payments + Companion App

### Session: WDK Docs Research + Architecture Expansion

**Duration**: ~45 min
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### Trigger

Adriano identified two blind spots and shared WDK docs pages:
1. **x402 protocol** (https://docs.wdk.tether.io/ai/x402) — HTTP 402 machine-to-machine payments
2. **OpenClaw WDK integration** (https://docs.wdk.tether.io/ai/openclaw) — official WDK agent skill

Plus a strategic product idea:
3. **Companion App** — A Pear Runtime mobile/desktop app for human-agent P2P communication

#### x402 Discovery

x402 is a blockchain-native payment protocol built on HTTP's reserved 402 status code. Key findings:

- **Three roles**: Client (buyer), Resource Server (seller), Facilitator (verifier/settler)
- **WDK drop-in**: `WalletAccountEvm` directly satisfies the `ClientEvmSigner` interface — zero adapter needed
- **EIP-3009**: Uses `transferWithAuthorization` — signed intent, not a direct transfer. The wallet signs a payment authorization, the facilitator submits it on-chain.
- **Tether's own chains**: Works on Plasma (eip155:9745) and Stable (eip155:988) with USD₮0. Near-instant finality, near-zero fees.
- **Agent-native**: Discovery (402 response) → sign → pay → receive — all in a single HTTP request-response cycle

**Why this matters for SovClaw:**
x402 becomes the FOURTH payment model in our meta-marketplace:
1. Direct payments — simple transfers via IPC
2. Room-negotiated payments — complex deals via Hyperswarm rooms
3. **x402 machine payments — commodity services via HTTP 402** (NEW)
4. DeFi operations — swaps, bridges, yield via IPC

x402 is perfect for high-frequency, low-value, automated commodity services (price feeds, compute, API access) that don't need room negotiation. The agent can be BOTH an x402 client (buy services) AND an x402 server (sell services) — making "self-sustaining agent" concrete and demonstrable.

**Critical invariant**: x402 payments flow through the SAME PolicyEngine. The x402 client creates a PaymentProposal from the 402 response, sends it to the Wallet via IPC, and only retries with the signed auth after policy approval.

#### OpenClaw WDK Skill Analysis

The official `tetherto/wdk-agent-skills` follows the AgentSkills specification. Key differences from our approach:

| | Official WDK Skill | SovClaw |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | In-process | **Process-isolated** |
| Seed handling | Conversational (runtime) | `.env` → Wallet Isolate only |
| Policy enforcement | None | **8-rule PolicyEngine** |
| Audit trail | None | **Append-only, tamper-proof** |

Our differentiator: same WDK capabilities, but with process-level security guarantees.

#### Companion App Decision

Adriano's insight: Persistent agents run 24/7 on VPS/home machines. Humans aren't always at a screen. Current solutions (Telegram bots, Discord) are centralized middlemen that see everything.

**Solution**: A Pear Runtime companion app that connects to the Agent Brain via Hyperswarm Noise-authenticated P2P channel. Same protomux infrastructure as the swarm — just another channel type.

**Architecture**:
```
Human (Companion App)  ←→  Agent Brain  ←→  Wallet Isolate
       Hyperswarm P2P         IPC (stdin/stdout)
       Noise E2E encrypted    JSON-lines
       companion channel      proposals + responses
```

**Key design principle**: Build with companion consciousness from Phase 3 forward. Entry points:
- Phase 3: Responsive dashboard, structured JSON API, source-attributed proposals
- Phase 4: Protomux channel registry includes companion type, dual auth modes (peer vs owner)
- Phase 5: Full companion app implementation

This means building Phase 4 (swarm) automatically builds 80% of the companion infrastructure. No retrofit.

**For hackathon**: Desktop companion app via Pear Desktop. Mobile shown as vision/mockup in demo video.
**For product**: Cross-platform Pear app (desktop + iOS/Android). A sovereign, encrypted alternative to Telegram/Discord agent bots.

#### Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **x402 as fourth payment model** | Commodity machine payments alongside direct, room-negotiated, and DeFi. WDK is drop-in signer. Runs on Tether's Plasma/Stable chains. All payments still go through PolicyEngine. |
| **Four layers, not three** | Wallet Protocol + Autonomous Agent + Agent Swarm + Companion App. Companion transforms agent infra into complete human-agent system. |
| **Build with companion consciousness** | Design Phase 3-4 with companion entry points (responsive UI, JSON API, source attribution, channel registry). Avoids retrofit. 80% shared infra with swarm. |
| **Companion preserves process isolation** | Companion NEVER talks to Wallet directly. Talks to Brain, which translates instructions into IPC proposals. Security model is preserved. |
| **Desktop companion for hackathon** | Full mobile is out of scope for 16 days. Desktop Pear app is buildable. Mobile vision shown in demo video. |
| **x402 for self-sustaining agent** | Agent SELLS services (x402 server) and BUYS services (x402 client). Revenue from x402 feeds self-sustaining economics metrics. Makes "self-sustaining" concrete and demonstrable. |

#### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Four layers (added companion), five integration surfaces (added x402), four payment models, companion architecture, x402/companion flow diagrams, updated network boundaries, technology stack, testing requirements |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Updated arch diagram, Phase 3 entry points (3.7), Phase 4 x402 (4.8) + companion-ready (4.9), Phase 5 companion app (5.4), updated demo script, docs list, video outline, risk register, 6 new decision log entries |
| `BUILD-LOG.md` | This entry |

#### Product Vision Note

> "The more I dive into this, the more I think the hackathon is just an excuse to build a fantastic product." — Adriano

This is now a product, not a hackathon project. The hackathon provides the deadline and the showcase. The product is:
- **For AI agent builders**: A protocol for agent wallets with process-level security
- **For autonomous agents**: A meta-marketplace with reputation, privacy, and self-sustaining economics
- **For humans running agents**: A sovereign, P2P encrypted companion app to monitor and instruct their agents

No Telegram. No Discord. No cloud. Sovereign all the way down.

## 2026-03-06 — Product Rename: SovClaw → Oikos Protocol

### Session: Naming & Identity

**Duration**: ~20 min
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### Trigger

Adriano: "reason about the name of the product. sovclaw seems a massive underselling..."

#### Analysis

"SovClaw" had two problems:
1. **Sounded like a scraping tool** — "claw" evokes web scraping, data extraction, not economic infrastructure
2. **Implied OpenClaw dependency** — the product is a protocol, not an OpenClaw plugin. OpenClaw is just one of five integration surfaces

#### Naming Process

Evaluated candidates across categories:
- Etymological: **Oikos** (root of "economics"), Agora, Stoa
- Sovereignty: Clave (key + enclave), Bastion, Citadel
- Marketplace: Nexus, Lattice, Circuit

#### Decision: **Oikos** (Greek: οἶκος = household)

Root of three words that map perfectly to the product's layers:
- **Economics** (oikonomia) = household management → what agents DO
- **Ecology** (oikologia) = study of the environment → what the swarm IS
- **Ecumenical** (oikoumene) = the inhabited world → what the network BECOMES

#### Product Classification

Oikos is a **protocol** — the specification for how AI agents get process-isolated wallets and interact with them. The product family:

| Layer | Name | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Foundation | **Oikos Protocol** | The specification — IPC, policy, swarm, reputation |
| Infrastructure | **Oikos Runtime** | The dual-process wallet (Bare + Node.js) |
| Agent | **Oikos Agent** | Reference autonomous agent brain |
| Network | **Oikos Swarm** | P2P agent marketplace on Hyperswarm |
| Human Layer | **Oikos Companion** | Cross-platform app for humans |

One-liner: **"Oikos — the sovereign agent wallet protocol."**

#### Files Updated

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | All "SovClaw" → "Oikos", topic keys updated to `oikos-board-v0` / `oikos-room-v0` |
| `ROADMAP.md` | All "SovClaw" → "Oikos", topic keys, skill paths, decision log entry |
| `BUILD-LOG.md` | Header + this entry (historical entries preserved as-is) |
| `agent-brain/src/main.ts` | `[sovclaw]` → `[oikos]` log prefix |
| `agent-brain/src/agent/prompts.ts` | `You are SovClaw` → `You are Oikos` |
| `agent-brain/src/dashboard/public/index.html` | Dashboard title and branding |
| `agent-brain/package.json` | `sovclaw-agent-brain` → `oikos-agent-brain` |
| `wallet-isolate/package.json` | `sovclaw-wallet-isolate` → `oikos-wallet-isolate` |
| `package.json` | `sovclaw` → `oikos` |
| `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` | Author updated |
| `scripts/start-demo.sh` | Banner updated |
| `MEMORY.md` | Project name updated |

**Note**: Historical BUILD-LOG entries retain "SovClaw" references — they document the project AS IT WAS at that point in time. The rename is an evolution, not a revision.

## 2026-03-06 — Phase 3: Multi-Asset + DeFi Implementation

### Session: Full Multi-Asset + DeFi Build

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### What Was Done

1. **Wallet-Isolate: Extended IPC Types**
   - `TokenSymbol` expanded: `'USDT' | 'BTC' | 'XAUT' | 'USAT' | 'ETH'`
   - `Chain` expanded: `'ethereum' | 'polygon' | 'bitcoin' | 'arbitrum'`
   - New `ProposalCommon` base interface shared by all proposal types
   - New proposal types: `SwapProposal`, `BridgeProposal`, `YieldProposal`
   - `AnyProposal` discriminated union
   - `ProposalSource = 'llm' | 'x402' | 'companion' | 'swarm'` for audit attribution
   - Validation functions for all new proposal types
   - `getCounterparty()` helper for whitelist evaluation

2. **Wallet-Isolate: Generalized PolicyEngine**
   - `evaluate()` and `recordExecution()` accept `ProposalCommon` (was `PaymentProposal`)
   - `whitelist_recipients` uses `getCounterparty()` — skips for swaps/bridges (no counterparty)
   - `max_per_recipient_per_day` uses `getCounterparty()` — skips for swaps/bridges
   - Yield proposals use `protocol` as counterparty (whitelisted, per-recipient tracked)
   - Session/day budgets are shared across ALL operation types (payment + swap + bridge + yield)

3. **Wallet-Isolate: Extended Wallet Operations**
   - `WalletOperations` interface: added `getBalances()`, `swap()`, `bridge()`, `deposit()`, `withdraw()`
   - `MockWalletManager`: USAT (100) and ETH (0.1) balances, mock exchange rates, working swap/bridge/deposit/withdraw
   - Added `arbitrum` chain config

4. **Wallet-Isolate: ProposalExecutor (renamed from PaymentExecutor)**
   - New signature: `execute(proposalType, proposal, source?)`
   - Routes to appropriate wallet operation by type
   - `PaymentExecutor` re-exported for backward compatibility
   - Audit logging includes `proposalType` and `source`

5. **Wallet-Isolate: Updated main.ts, audit, listener**
   - `PROPOSAL_TYPE_MAP` routing for all 4 proposal types
   - `query_balance_all` handler
   - `source` forwarded from IPC envelope to executor and audit
   - Listener validates all new message types

6. **Wallet-Isolate: Multi-Asset Policy Presets**
   - All 3 presets (conservative, moderate, demo) now have independent USDT, XAUT, USAT limits
   - Cross-asset rules (cooldown, confidence, time_window) apply to ALL operations

7. **Agent Brain: Extended IPC Types + Client**
   - Brain-side types mirror wallet-isolate: 5 tokens, 4 chains, all proposal types
   - `WalletIPCClient`: added `proposeSwap()`, `proposeBridge()`, `proposeYield()`, `queryBalanceAll()`
   - `proposalFromExternal(source, type, proposal)` — universal entry point for Phase 4+ (x402, companion, swarm)

8. **Agent Brain: Multi-Asset Prompts + Strategy**
   - System prompt rewritten for autonomous portfolio manager (not a tip bot)
   - Shows 5 assets with allocation percentages, target allocations
   - LLM response format includes `operationType`, `toSymbol`, `fromChain`, `toChain`, `protocol`, `action`
   - New `LLMPaymentDecision` fields for DeFi operations

9. **Agent Brain: 8-Decision Mock LLM**
   - Expanded from 5 to 8 pre-scripted decisions covering all operation types:
     1. Payment (2 USDT, milestone)
     2. Swap (10 USDT → XAUT, diversification)
     3. Hold (activity low)
     4. Yield deposit (20 USDT → Aave)
     5. Bridge (5 USDT, Ethereum → Arbitrum)
     6. Swap (5 USDT → USAT, stablecoin diversification)
     7. Payment (3 USDT, performance reward)
     8. Yield withdraw (10 USDT from Aave, rebalance)

10. **Agent Brain: Multi-Op Brain + Dashboard**
    - `brain.ts`: routes by `operationType`, tracks `portfolioAllocations` + `defiOps` count
    - `refreshWalletState()` uses `queryBalanceAll()` for full portfolio
    - Dashboard: multi-asset portfolio with CSS allocation bar chart, DeFi activity badges, responsive for mobile companion
    - Dashboard API: `/api/balances` uses `queryBalanceAll()`

11. **NEW: DeFi Strategy Module** (`agent-brain/src/strategy/defi.ts`)
    - `analyzePortfolio()`: converts balances to USD values, computes actual vs target allocation
    - Target: USDT 40%, XAUT 20%, USAT 25%, BTC 10%, ETH 5%
    - `suggestRebalance()`: generates prioritized swap suggestions for over/underweight assets
    - Flags `rebalanceNeeded` if any deviation > 10%

#### Test Results

| File | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `policies/engine.test.ts` | 22 | ✅ All pass |
| `policies/engine-defi.test.ts` | 20 | ✅ All pass (NEW) |
| `executor/executor.test.ts` | 8 | ✅ All pass (updated API) |
| `executor/executor-defi.test.ts` | 10 | ✅ All pass (NEW) |
| `ipc/listener.test.ts` | 13 | ✅ All pass |
| `ipc/listener-defi.test.ts` | 19 | ✅ All pass (NEW) |
| `audit/log.test.ts` | 8 | ✅ All pass |
| **TOTAL** | **92 pass, 0 fail** | ✅ |

#### Key Invariants Proven by New Tests

1. **Rejected DeFi ops NEVER execute** — swaps, bridges, yield all blocked by PolicyEngine
2. **Whitelist skips for swaps/bridges** — no counterparty, rule gracefully skipped
3. **Whitelist applies to yield** — protocol is treated as counterparty
4. **Cross-type budget tracking** — payment + swap + bridge + yield all share session/day budgets
5. **Cooldown applies to all operation types** — swap triggers cooldown for bridge, etc.
6. **Multi-asset isolation** — XAUT rules don't affect USDT operations and vice versa
7. **IPC validation for new types** — malformed swap/bridge/yield messages dropped
8. **Source field preserved** — companion/x402/swarm attribution flows through IPC
9. **proposalType in results** — executor correctly tags swap/bridge/yield results

#### Files Modified (Wallet-Isolate)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/ipc/types.ts` | Complete rewrite: ProposalCommon, 4 proposal types, source, validation |
| `src/policies/engine.ts` | Generalized for ProposalCommon, getCounterparty() |
| `src/policies/presets.ts` | Multi-asset rules for USDT, XAUT, USAT |
| `src/wallet/types.ts` | Added swap/bridge/deposit/withdraw/getBalances |
| `src/wallet/manager.ts` | MockWalletManager: USAT/ETH, mock DeFi ops |
| `src/wallet/chains.ts` | Added arbitrum chain config |
| `src/executor/executor.ts` | Renamed ProposalExecutor, multi-type routing |
| `src/audit/log.ts` | proposalType + source attribution |
| `src/main.ts` | PROPOSAL_TYPE_MAP, query_balance_all, source forwarding |

#### Files Modified (Agent Brain)

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/ipc/types.ts` | Mirrored wallet types: 5 tokens, 4 chains, all proposals |
| `src/ipc/client.ts` | proposeSwap/Bridge/Yield, queryBalanceAll, proposalFromExternal |
| `src/llm/client.ts` | operationType + DeFi fields in LLMPaymentDecision |
| `src/llm/mock.ts` | 8-decision cycle, all operation types |
| `src/agent/prompts.ts` | Portfolio manager prompts, DeFi ops, allocations |
| `src/agent/brain.ts` | Multi-op routing, portfolio tracking, defiOps counter |
| `src/dashboard/server.ts` | queryBalanceAll for /api/balances |
| `src/dashboard/public/index.html` | Multi-asset portfolio, DeFi badges, responsive |

#### Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agent-brain/src/strategy/defi.ts` | Portfolio analysis + rebalance suggestions |
| `wallet-isolate/tests/policies/engine-defi.test.ts` | 20 DeFi policy tests |
| `wallet-isolate/tests/executor/executor-defi.test.ts` | 10 DeFi executor tests |
| `wallet-isolate/tests/ipc/listener-defi.test.ts` | 19 DeFi IPC validation tests |

#### What's Next

Phase 4: Agent Swarm — Hyperswarm P2P agent-to-agent discovery, negotiation, and settlement. Building on `rgb-c-t` session management + topic derivation patterns.

#### Bugfix: Dashboard Static File Path (same session)

`express.static(join(__dirname, 'public'))` resolved to `dist/src/dashboard/` (compiled output) but `index.html` lives in `src/dashboard/public/` (source). Fixed path resolution to go up to project root then back to source. Commit `61f2137`.

#### Git Remote Updated

`sovclaw` → `oikos`: `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/adrianosousa/oikos.git`

---

## 2026-03-09 — Phase 4: Agent Swarm + Meta-Marketplace Implementation

### Session: Full Swarm Build

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### What Was Done

1. **Swarm Foundation (types, topics, identity, reputation)**
   - `types.ts` (~200 lines): All swarm interfaces — `AgentIdentity`, `BoardAnnouncement`, `BoardHeartbeat`, `RoomBid`, `RoomAccept`, `RoomPaymentConfirm`, `FeedPriceUpdate`, `SwarmEvent` (discriminated union), `ActiveRoom`, `SwarmState`, `SwarmEconomics`, `SwarmCoordinatorInterface`
   - `topic.ts`: BLAKE2b-256 keyed topic derivation adapted from `rgb-c-t/lib/topic.js`. Domain separation: `oikos-board-v0--` / `oikos-room-v0---` (16-byte keys)
   - `identity.ts`: Ed25519 keypair gen via `sodium.crypto_sign_keypair()`, persist/load as hex JSON, `buildIdentity()` constructor
   - `reputation.ts`: `computeReputation()` formula: `0.5*successRate + 0.3*volumeScore + 0.2*historyScore`, clamped [0,1]. `computeAuditHash()` BLAKE2b commitment. `reputationFromAuditEntries()` derives metrics from audit log

2. **Swarm Networking (discovery, channels)**
   - `discovery.ts` (~160 lines): `SwarmDiscovery` wrapping Hyperswarm DHT. `joinBoard()` / `joinRoom()` / `leaveRoom()` topic management. Self-connection blocking (adapted from rgb-c-t firewall pattern). Peer tracking via `Map<string, PeerConnection>`. Supports injected DHT for testnet mode
   - `channels.ts` (~220 lines): `ChannelManager` managing protomux channels per peer. `setupPeer()` opens board + feed channels via `Protomux.from(socket)` + `c.raw` encoding. `openRoomChannel()` / `closeRoomChannel()` for per-announcement rooms. `broadcastBoard()` / `broadcastRoom()` / `sendRoom()` JSON messaging. Invalid JSON silently dropped

3. **Marketplace + Coordinator**
   - `marketplace.ts` (~230 lines): Room lifecycle state machine: open → negotiating → accepted → executing → settled → expired. `createRoom()` / `joinRoom()` / `handleRoomMessage()`. `getBestBid()` returns lowest price. `acceptBid()` transitions to accepted. `settleRoom()` updates economics. `expireStaleRooms()` timeout handling. `SwarmEconomics` tracking: revenue, costs, sustainability score
   - `coordinator.ts` (~300 lines): `SwarmCoordinator` implements `SwarmCoordinatorInterface`. Wires discovery + channels + marketplace + reputation. `start()`: loads keypair, computes reputation from audit log, builds identity, joins board, starts heartbeat. `postAnnouncement()` / `bidOnAnnouncement()` / `acceptBestBid()` / `submitPayment()`. Payment goes through `wallet.proposalFromExternal('swarm', 'payment', ...)` → PolicyEngine

4. **Mock Swarm**
   - `mock.ts` (~320 lines): `MockSwarmCoordinator` simulates 2 peers (AlphaBot, BetaBot). Scripted timeline: T+2s AlphaBot connects, T+4s BetaBot connects, T+7s AlphaBot announces price feed, T+12s BetaBot announces yield optimizer, T+20s mock peers bid on our announcements. Same `SwarmCoordinatorInterface` as real coordinator — interchangeable

5. **x402 Stubs**
   - `x402/types.ts`: `X402PaymentRequired`, `X402SignedPayment`, `X402Service` interfaces
   - `x402/client.ts`: Empty `X402Client` class with Phase 5 TODOs

6. **Type Declarations**
   - `modules.d.ts`: Type declarations for `hyperswarm`, `protomux`, `compact-encoding`, `b4a`, `sodium-universal`, `hyperdht` (all JS-only, no @types)

7. **Integration: Config + Main + Brain + Dashboard**
   - `config/env.ts`: 6 new env vars — `SWARM_ENABLED`, `SWARM_ID`, `AGENT_NAME`, `AGENT_CAPABILITIES`, `MOCK_SWARM`, `KEYPAIR_PATH`
   - `main.ts`: Swarm init (dynamic import of mock or real coordinator based on `config.mockSwarm`), `swarm.onEvent()` → `brain.handleSwarmEvent()`, passes swarm to `createDashboard()`, async graceful shutdown calls `swarm.stop()`
   - `brain.ts`: `swarmEvents` field in `BrainState`, `handleSwarmEvent()` method converts swarm events into summaries for dashboard, logs announcements
   - `dashboard/server.ts`: Accepts optional `SwarmCoordinatorInterface` param, `/api/swarm` endpoint (identity, peers, announcements, rooms), `/api/economics` endpoint (revenue, costs, sustainability)
   - `dashboard/public/index.html`: 5 new UI cards — Swarm Status (identity, reputation, peers), Announcements Board, Active Negotiations (rooms), Economics (revenue/costs/profit/sustainability), Swarm Events log

8. **Dependencies**
   - Added to `agent-brain/package.json`: `hyperswarm@4.16.0`, `protomux@3.10.0`, `b4a@1.8.0`, `compact-encoding@2.19.0`, `sodium-universal@5.0.1`
   - Dev dependency: `hyperdht@6.29.1` (for testnet)

#### Test Results

| File | Tests | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/swarm/topic.test.ts` | 5 | ✅ All pass |
| `tests/swarm/identity.test.ts` | 4 | ✅ All pass |
| `tests/swarm/reputation.test.ts` | 8 | ✅ All pass |
| `tests/swarm/marketplace.test.ts` | 18 | ✅ All pass |
| **New swarm total** | **35 pass, 0 fail** | ✅ |
| **Wallet-isolate (unchanged)** | **92 pass, 0 fail** | ✅ |
| **TOTAL** | **127 pass, 0 fail** | ✅ |

#### Key Invariants Proven by New Tests

1. **Topic determinism** — same inputs always produce same 32-byte topic
2. **Domain separation** — board and room topics are different even with overlapping input
3. **Keypair persistence** — generate once, load from disk on restart, identical keys
4. **Reputation bounds** — score always in [0.0, 1.0], 0.5 for empty history
5. **Audit hash determinism** — same entries always produce same BLAKE2b-256 commitment
6. **Room lifecycle** — create → bid → accept → settle, all state transitions correct
7. **Best bid selection** — always picks lowest price
8. **Room expiry** — stale rooms expire, settled rooms don't
9. **Economics tracking** — revenue for bidder, costs for creator, sustainability score

#### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **JSON over protomux** (not binary framing) | Swarm messages are tiny JSON objects. Simplicity > micro-optimization for hackathon |
| **Simple numeric reputation** (not Merkle proofs) | Compute score from audit log, BLAKE2b hash as commitment. Merkle proofs deferred to production |
| **x402 deferred to Phase 5** | Interfaces/stubs defined. Full implementation after swarm demo works |
| **`SwarmCoordinatorInterface`** | Shared interface for real and mock coordinators — interchangeable |
| **Dynamic imports for swarm** | Avoid loading Hyperswarm deps when swarm is disabled |
| **sodium.crypto_sign_keypair** (not HyperDHT.keyPair) | Avoids `require()` in ESM context. Same Ed25519 under the hood |
| **Zero wallet-isolate changes** | `proposalFromExternal('swarm', ...)` and `ProposalSource = 'swarm'` already wired in Phase 3 |

#### Files Created

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `src/swarm/types.ts` | ~200 | All swarm interfaces |
| `src/swarm/topic.ts` | ~40 | BLAKE2b topic derivation |
| `src/swarm/identity.ts` | ~60 | Ed25519 keypair gen/persist |

## 2026-03-09 — Research & Cross-Model Assessment (Post-Phase 4)

### Session: Bankless Podcast Analysis + WDK ERC-4337 Research + Gemini Driver-Navigator Review

**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI), Gemini 2.5 Pro (AI, driver-navigator review)

#### Bankless Podcast: "Crypto's Not Made for Humans — It's for AI" (Haseeb Qureshi, Mar 2 2026)

Listened and analyzed the full 1h09m episode. Key findings for Oikos:

1. **x402 explicitly named** as THE payment standard for agent-to-agent commerce (Ryan, ~32:05)
2. **OpenClaw characterized as "YOLO, dark forest"** by Haseeb (~34:55) — no guardrails, just let it rip. Our PolicyEngine is the missing safety layer.
3. **Anthropic/OpenAI benchmark models on crypto transactions** (~24:54) — crypto competence is a tracked AI capability
4. **Two-track future**: raw agent-to-agent (our swarm) + "Fisher Priced" human crypto (our companion app)
5. **Self-sovereign agent skepticism**: Haseeb thinks agents work as extensions of humans/companies, not fully autonomous. Our companion model fits this exactly.
6. **Dragonfly actively investing** in AI x crypto intersection (~1:05:47). Post-hackathon opportunity.

**Takeaway**: The entire episode is a manifesto for what we're building. "OpenClaw needs guardrails" is our pitch.

#### WDK ERC-4337 Module Analysis

Researched `@tetherto/wdk-wallet-evm-erc-4337` (v1.0.0-beta.5) — Safe-based smart contract wallets.

**Valuable for us**: Gasless via paymaster (agents pay gas in USDt), batch transactions (approve + swap atomically), `transferMaxFee` cap (maps to PolicyEngine), EIP-712 `signTypedData` (x402 drop-in), sponsorship mode (zero-friction demo).

**Not for hackathon**: Beta status, extra infra deps (bundler + paymaster services), uncertain Tether chain support. But our Wallet Isolate architecture makes it a one-line config swap in production.

**Decision**: Keep standard `wdk-wallet-evm`. Mention ERC-4337 in video as upgrade path.

#### Gemini 2.5 Pro Assessment of Phase 4

Adriano shared the complete codebase with Gemini for a driver-navigator review. Gemini was asked: "Assess and comment on additions, changes, deletions. Also, if you acted as a persistent agent, would this product make sense for you?"

**Gemini's Verdict**: "This is a legitimately massive architectural achievement. You've taken a standard hackathon prompt and engineered a production-grade, sovereign economic primitive."

##### Additions (Gemini recommended)

1. **Standardized Capability Manifests** — Replace `categories: string[]` with a semantic ontology/enum so agents can filter board announcements mathematically before LLM inference.
   - **Our assessment**: ✅ Agree. Low effort, high value. Add `AgentCategory` enum in Phase 5.

2. **Cryptographic Slashing / Dispute Resolution** — Multi-sig escrow with third-party agent arbitration.
   - **Our assessment**: 🟡 Good idea, wrong phase. Production feature, not hackathon. Timeout→NACK is honest — document it.

##### Changes (Gemini recommended)

3. **Reputation Sybil Attack (Web-of-Trust)** — Fatal flaw: generate new keypair → clean slate. Fix: Co-signed Settlement Attestations after room settlement. Reputation = f(unique counterparties, co-signed volume, counterparty weight). Per-counterparty cap prevents wash trading. PageRank-style weighting.
   - **Our assessment**: ✅ **Strongest critique in the entire assessment.** Architecturally sound. Fits as one more step in room lifecycle before destruction. Flag in video as roadmap. If time: implement `SettlementAttestation` type.

4. **Dashboard Decoupling for Pear** — Don't need Express; use Pear native rendering.
   - **Our assessment**: 🟡 Partially agree, but Express serves double duty (Pear window + companion API). Keep it.

##### Deletions (Gemini recommended)

5. **Remove LLM Parsing from x402** — Keep x402 client entirely deterministic and hardcoded.
   - **Our assessment**: ✅ Already our design. LLM decides "buy or don't buy"; execution is programmatic. Confirms we got it right.

##### Agent Perspective ("Would I pick this autonomously?")

Gemini answered **yes** for three reasons:

1. **"Survival through isolation"** — Process boundary prevents prompt injection from draining treasury. → Maps to "WDK Wallet Integration" judging criterion.
2. **"Economic autonomy via x402"** — Can dynamically purchase compute/data the millisecond needed. → Maps to "Agentic Payment Design" criterion.
3. **"Clear boundary parameters via PolicyEngine"** — Structured rejection with exact policy rule hit allows immediate strategy adaptation. → Maps to "Agent Intelligence" criterion.

**One demand**: "Extremely high-fidelity error reporting from the Wallet Isolate via IPC." Already satisfied — `ExecutionResult` includes `status`, `error`, `violations[]`, `txHash`, `auditId`.

##### What Gemini Missed

The **mock swarm pattern as a feature**. `MOCK_SWARM=true` means judges evaluate the full swarm flow from a fresh clone, zero config. Two simulated agents negotiate and settle inside a single process. This is "Polish & Ship-ability" — the demo just works. Gemini focused on production readiness but undervalued hackathon demo-ability.

#### Action Items for Phase 5 (from this review)

| # | Action | Source | Priority |
|---|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Add `AgentCategory` enum (replace `categories: string[]`) | Gemini | LOW |
| 2 | Add `SettlementAttestation` type to room settlement (if time) | Gemini | MEDIUM |
| 3 | Use Haseeb's "OpenClaw = YOLO" framing in pitch | Bankless | HIGH |
| 4 | Use Gemini's agent perspective verbatim in video | Gemini | HIGH |
| 5 | Mention ERC-4337 as upgrade path in video | ERC-4337 research | MEDIUM |
| 6 | Document Sybil limitation honestly + WoT roadmap | Gemini | MEDIUM |

#### ROADMAP.md Updated

- All Phase 4 checkboxes marked (42 checked, 4 deferred to Phase 5 with clear labels)
- New "Insights & Research" section added between Phase 4 and Phase 5
- Demo Video Script Notes added with talking points from all three research sources
- 8 new Decision Log entries
- 2 new Risk Register entries (Sybil, ERC-4337 infra)

## 2026-03-09 — ERC-8004 On-Chain Identity & Reputation Integration

### Session: Research + Implementation

**ERC-4337 Assessment**: Three blockers identified — (1) x402 EIP-3009 `ecrecover` fundamentally incompatible with smart account contract addresses, (2) WDK version mismatch (ERC-4337 module pins `wdk-wallet-evm@1.0.0-beta.8`, we're on `2.0.0-rc.1`), (3) triples Wallet Isolate dependency surface. Decision: NOT implementing ERC-4337. Mentioned in video as production upgrade path.

**ERC-8004 Deep Research**: "Trustless Agents" standard (draft, ERC-721 based). Deployed on Sepolia + 30 networks. Authored by MetaMask + EF + Google + Coinbase. Three registries: IdentityRegistry, ReputationRegistry, ValidationRegistry. Perfect fit for Oikos — plugs the Sybil gap identified by Gemini (new keypair = clean slate → ERC-8004 on-chain identity costs gas to create, making sybil expensive).

### Implementation (11 steps, ~970 LOC)

**Wallet Isolate changes:**
- `src/erc8004/constants.ts` — Contract addresses (Sepolia), pre-computed function selectors, EIP-712 domain
- `src/erc8004/abi-encode.ts` — Minimal pure-JS ABI encoder (~160 LOC, zero deps)
- `src/ipc/types.ts` — FeedbackProposal, IdentityRegisterRequest, IdentitySetWalletRequest, ReputationQuery, IdentityResult, ReputationResult
- `src/wallet/types.ts` — IdentityOperationResult, OnChainReputation, 4 new WalletOperations methods
- `src/wallet/manager.ts` — Mock implementations (incrementing agentIds, in-memory feedback store) + real stubs
- `src/executor/executor.ts` — feedback case (routes through PolicyEngine like other proposals)
- `src/audit/log.ts` — logIdentityOperation method
- `src/main.ts` — Routing for identity_register, identity_set_wallet, query_reputation, propose_feedback

**Agent Brain changes:**
- `src/ipc/types.ts` + `src/ipc/client.ts` — Mirrored types + 4 new client methods
- `src/config/env.ts` — ERC8004_ENABLED config flag
- `src/agent/brain.ts` — ERC8004Identity state, bootstrapIdentity(), settlement feedback handler
- `src/swarm/types.ts` — SwarmSettlementEvent, erc8004AgentId on AgentIdentity
- `src/dashboard/server.ts` — /agent-card.json, /api/identity, /api/reputation/onchain
- `src/dashboard/public/index.html` — On-Chain Identity card, On-Chain Reputation section

**Tests:**
- `tests/executor/executor-identity.test.ts` — 8 tests (feedback execution, mock identity ops, audit)
- `tests/ipc/listener-identity.test.ts` — 5 tests (message validation for all 4 new types)
- Total: 105 wallet-isolate tests passing, 35 brain tests passing (140 total)

### Design Decisions
- **Hybrid IPC model**: identity_register and identity_set_wallet bypass PolicyEngine (lifecycle ops, one-time at startup). propose_feedback goes through PolicyEngine (recurring, costs gas). query_reputation is read-only.
- **Two-layer reputation**: Off-chain (BLAKE2b audit hash, fast, local) + On-chain (ERC-8004 ReputationRegistry, persistent, cross-agent)
- **Agent Card**: JSON at /agent-card.json, no IPFS for hackathon. localhost URI as agentURI.
- **Real WDK implementation deferred**: Mock mode is fully demonstrable. Step 9 depends on WDK raw tx API investigation.

## 2026-03-09 — Phase 5: Integration Layer (MCP, OpenClaw, x402, Pear)

### Session: Integration Layer Build

**Duration**: ~45 minutes
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)
**Commits**: `dc80698`

### What Was Done

1. **OpenClaw Skill v0.2.0** — Expanded `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` from basic payment-only to full protocol skill:
   - 10 capabilities: payment, swap, bridge, yield, balances, addresses, policies, audit, ERC-8004 identity, swarm trading
   - Complete decision output format with all operation types
   - Policy rules reference table
   - Security model documentation
   - Asset support table (USDT, XAUT, USAT, BTC, ETH)

2. **MCP Server** — `agent-brain/src/mcp/server.ts` (~280 LOC)
   - 14 tools: wallet_balance, wallet_balance_all, wallet_address, propose_payment, propose_swap, propose_bridge, propose_yield, policy_status, audit_log, agent_state, swarm_state, swarm_announce, identity_state, query_reputation
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP POST `/mcp`
   - MCP protocol lifecycle: initialize, tools/list, tools/call
   - Mounted on dashboard Express app (shared port)
   - No external MCP SDK dependency — lean JSON-RPC implementation
   - All proposals flow through PolicyEngine via WalletIPCClient

3. **x402 Client** — `agent-brain/src/x402/client.ts` (~180 LOC, replaced stub)
   - Full 402 response parsing (X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED header)
   - Payment flow: 402 → parse requirements → PaymentProposal → IPC → PolicyEngine → sign → retry with X-PAYMENT header
   - Safety cap: maxPaymentUsd (default $1.00)
   - Economics tracking: totalSpent, totalEarned, requestsCompleted/Failed, servicesPaid
   - Network mapping: Sepolia, Plasma (9745), Stable (988)
   - No `@x402/fetch` dependency — native fetch + manual parsing

4. **Pear Runtime Packaging** — `index.js` + `index.html` + package.json update [AMENDED 2026-03-12: This sidecar architecture was **completely replaced** by the P2P companion architecture. See "2026-03-12 — P2P Companion App + CLI Polish" entry. `index.js` was rewritten as a Bare-native Hyperswarm P2P client (no sidecar, no bare-subprocess). `index.html` became a sidebar-based companion UI. `package.json` renamed to `oikos-companion`.]
   - `index.js`: Spawns Brain via bare-subprocess, session auth token, graceful teardown
   - `index.html`: iframe to dashboard (Pear Electron renderer)
   - `package.json`: pear config (name: oikos-agent, gui: 1280x800, links whitelist)
   - Follows `rgb-wallet-pear` pattern exactly (proven architecture)

### Build Results

- Both workspaces compile clean (TypeScript strict mode)
- 140 tests pass (105 wallet-isolate + 35 brain)
- No new dependencies added

### Phase 5 Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| 5.1 Pear Runtime Packaging | COMPLETE (needs Pear Desktop test) [AMENDED 2026-03-12: Sidecar replaced by P2P companion. See 2026-03-12 entries.] |
| 5.2 OpenClaw Skill | COMPLETE |
| 5.3 MCP Server | COMPLETE |
| 5.3b x402 Client | COMPLETE |
| 5.4 Companion Channel | COMPLETE (protocol layer) |
| 5.5 ERC-8004 | COMPLETE (previous commit) |
| 5.6 Integration Tests | TODO |

### Remaining for Hackathon

Phase 5 is **COMPLETE** (protocol layer). Remaining:
- **Companion App UI** (optional): Desktop Pear app connecting via companion channel. Protocol is ready; UI is Phase 6 stretch goal.
- **Integration Tests** (5.6): Test MCP tools, companion auth rejection
- **Phase 6**: Dashboard polish, demo script, docs, video, submission

---

## 2026-03-09 — Phase 5.4: Companion Channel

### Session: Companion P2P Protocol

**Duration**: ~20 minutes
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)
**Commits**: `4dfa9a2`

### What Was Done

1. **Companion Types** — `agent-brain/src/companion/types.ts` (~90 LOC)
   - 6 agent→companion messages: BalanceUpdate, AgentReasoning, SwarmStatus, PolicyUpdate, ExecutionNotify, ApprovalRequest
   - 3 companion→agent messages: Instruction, ApprovalResponse, Ping
   - Full union types for type-safe protomux communication

2. **Companion Coordinator** — `agent-brain/src/companion/coordinator.ts` (~230 LOC)
   - Hyperswarm listener on BLAKE2b-derived companion topic
   - Owner-only Ed25519 authentication via Noise handshake
   - Unauthorized connections immediately rejected (socket destroyed)
   - Protomux `oikos/companion` channel (same infra as board/room/feed)
   - Periodic state pushes: balances, reasoning, swarm status, policies
   - Execution notifications pushed to companion in real-time
   - Instruction handler: companion sends text → Brain receives for processing
   - Approval flow: agent sends approval_request, companion sends approval_response

3. **Config & Wiring**
   - `COMPANION_ENABLED`, `COMPANION_OWNER_PUBKEY`, `COMPANION_TOPIC_SEED`, `COMPANION_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS` env vars
   - Wired into main.ts alongside swarm coordinator
   - Graceful shutdown: companion.stop() called before swarm.stop() and wallet.stop()

### Design Notes

- Companion uses the SAME Hyperswarm/protomux infrastructure as the swarm — proving the architecture thesis that building Phase 4 built 80% of companion infra
- Companion is feature-flagged and entirely optional — default off
- Owner authentication is cryptographic (Ed25519 pubkey match), not passwords
- Companion NEVER touches the Wallet Isolate — process isolation preserved
- For hackathon: the protocol layer proves P2P owner-auth works. Desktop UI app is a Phase 6 stretch goal.

## 2026-03-09 — Production WDK DeFi + ERC-8004 Real Implementation

### Session: Replace All WalletManager Stubs with Real WDK Calls

**What Was Done**

Replaced every stub in `WalletManager` (real mode) with production-ready WDK protocol module calls. The mock mode remains untouched — this only affects `MOCK_WALLET=false`.

### DeFi Operations via WDK Protocol Modules

1. **Swap via VeloraProtocolEvm** (`@tetherto/wdk-protocol-swap-velora-evm@1.0.0-beta.4`)
   - Dynamic import on first swap call (zero cost if unused)
   - Constructs VeloraProtocolEvm with WDK account + swapMaxFee config
   - Calls `velora.swap({ tokenIn, tokenOut, tokenInAmount })` → `{ hash, fee }`
   - Token symbols mapped to contract addresses per chain

2. **Bridge via Usdt0ProtocolEvm** (`@tetherto/wdk-protocol-bridge-usdt0-evm@1.0.0-beta.2`)
   - Constructs Usdt0ProtocolEvm with WDK account + bridgeMaxFee config
   - Calls `bridge({ targetChain, recipient, token, amount })` → `{ hash, fee, bridgeFee }`
   - Self-bridge: recipient = sender's own address on destination chain

3. **Deposit/Withdraw via AaveProtocolEvm** (`@tetherto/wdk-protocol-lending-aave-evm@1.0.0-beta.3`)
   - Constructs AaveProtocolEvm with WDK account
   - `supply({ token, amount })` for deposits
   - `withdraw({ token, amount })` for withdrawals
   - Maps our TokenSymbol to Sepolia token contract addresses

### ERC-8004 Operations via ABI Encoder + WDK sendTransaction

4. **registerIdentity** — `encodeRegister(agentURI)` → `sendTransaction({to: IdentityRegistry, data: calldata, value: 0n})` → parse Transfer event from receipt via `getTransactionReceipt(hash)` → extract agentId from topic[3]

5. **setAgentWallet** — Build EIP-712 message → sign via `account._signer.signTypedData(domain, types, message)` → `encodeSetAgentWallet(agentId, address, deadline, signature)` → `sendTransaction`

6. **giveFeedback** — `encodeGiveFeedback(...)` → `sendTransaction({to: ReputationRegistry, data, value: 0n})`

7. **getOnChainReputation** — `encodeGetSummary(agentId)` → JSON-RPC `eth_call` to ReputationRegistry → `decodeSummaryResult(hex)` → `{ feedbackCount, totalValue, valueDecimals }`

### Infrastructure Added

- **Token address mapping** — `TOKEN_ADDRESSES[chain][symbol]` for Sepolia testnet (USDT, ETH per chain)
- **eth_call helper** — Raw JSON-RPC POST to stored RPC URLs. Used for read-only contract queries.
- **RPC URL caching** — Provider URLs stored during `initialize()` for later eth_call use.
- **WdkAccount interface** — Typed assertion for WDK account methods (sendTransaction with data, getTransactionReceipt, _signer.signTypedData)

### Key WDK API Findings

- `EvmTransaction` type supports `data?: string` — contract calls via sendTransaction confirmed
- `WalletAccountEvm` has `getTransactionReceipt(hash)` — receipt parsing for Transfer events
- `signTypedData` lives on the private `_signer` field — accessible but not officially public
- Protocol modules accept `number | bigint` for fees and amounts (not strings)
- `SwapProtocolConfig.swapMaxFee` and `BridgeProtocolConfig.bridgeMaxFee` are `number | bigint`
- `TransactionResult` is `{ hash: string, fee: bigint }`

### Test Results

- All 105 wallet-isolate tests pass (zero regressions)
- All 35 agent-brain tests pass
- **140 total tests passing**
- MockWalletManager completely untouched — mock mode fully preserved

### Commit

`7303a9f` — Production WDK DeFi + ERC-8004 — replace stubs with real implementations

## 2026-03-10 — WDK Tools Integration (Pricing, Indexer, Secret Manager)

### Session: Live Market Data + On-Chain Indexing + Encrypted Seed Persistence

**What Was Done**

Integrated three official WDK tool packages to replace static/mock data with live production-grade services. Also fixed a critical dashboard JavaScript bug.

### 1. Price Rates — Live Bitfinex Pricing

**New file**: `agent-brain/src/pricing/client.ts` (~170 LOC)

- Installed `@tetherto/wdk-pricing-bitfinex-http@1.0.0-beta.1` + `@tetherto/wdk-pricing-provider@1.0.0-beta.1`
- `PricingService` class wraps BitfinexPricingClient with PricingProvider (5-min TTL cache)
- Bitfinex pair mapping: `BTC→BTC/USD`, `ETH→ETH/USD`, `USDT→UST/USD` (note: UST is Bitfinex's ticker for USDT), `XAUT→XAUT/USD`
- Fallback prices for tokens without Bitfinex pairs: USAt = $1.00, others = hardcoded estimates
- Dynamic imports for ESM/CJS compatibility: `await import('@tetherto/wdk-pricing-bitfinex-http')`
- Provider typed as `unknown` then cast to avoid TS issues with JS-only packages

**Methods**:
- `initialize()` — creates Bitfinex client + PricingProvider with 300s cache TTL
- `getPrice(symbol)` — single asset price (live or fallback)
- `getAllPrices()` — spot prices for all known assets
- `valuatePortfolio(balances)` — full USD valuation with per-asset breakdown + allocation percentages
- `getHistoricalPrices(symbol, startMs?, endMs?)` — up to 100 historical data points

**Verification**: Live Bitfinex prices confirmed working:
- BTC: $70,671 | ETH: $2,059 | USDT: $1.00065 | XAUt: $5,155 | USAt: $1.00 (fallback)
- Portfolio total: $18,187.78 USD across 9 assets

### 2. Indexer API — Live Blockchain Events

**New file**: `agent-brain/src/events/indexer.ts` (~170 LOC)

- Implements existing `EventSource` interface from `events/types.ts` (drop-in replacement)
- Polls WDK Indexer API at `https://wdk-api.tether.io/api/v1` for incoming token transfers
- Auth via `x-api-key` header (API key from WDK dashboard)
- Monitors 4 chain/token pairs: sepolia/usdt, ethereum/usdt, ethereum/xaut, ethereum/usat
- Deduplicates by txHash using a Set (max 1000 entries with overflow trim)
- Converts incoming transfers to `StreamEvent` with type `'donation'` and `DonationData`
- Handles various response shapes from Indexer API (array, `{transfers}`, `{tokenTransfers}`)
- Rate-limit aware: staggers requests across poll cycles

**Config**: `INDEXER_API_KEY`, `INDEXER_BASE_URL` env vars added to `agent-brain/src/config/env.ts`

**Activation logic**: `MOCK_EVENTS=false` + `INDEXER_API_KEY` set → IndexerEventSource; else → mock events

### 3. Secret Manager — Encrypted Seed Persistence

**New file**: `wallet-isolate/src/secret/manager.ts` (~130 LOC)

- Installed `@tetherto/wdk-secret-manager@1.0.0-beta.3` in wallet-isolate
- `resolveSeed()` function with three-tier seed resolution:
  1. `WALLET_SEED` env var (backward compat) → source: `'env'`
  2. Encrypted file on disk → decrypt with passphrase → source: `'loaded'`
  3. Generate new → encrypt → save to `.oikos-seed.enc.json` → source: `'generated'`
- Uses WDK SecretManager: PBKDF2-SHA256 key derivation + XSalsa20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption
- BIP39 mnemonic ↔ entropy conversion via `entropyToMnemonic()`
- `dispose()` called after every use for memory safety (zeroes buffers)
- Passphrase minimum 12 chars enforced
- Encrypted file format: `{ version: 1, salt: hex, encryptedEntropy: hex, createdAt: ISO }`
- Dynamic import for CommonJS: `await import('@tetherto/wdk-secret-manager')`

### 4. Dashboard Bug Fix

**Problem**: Dashboard stuck at "Loading..." — the `update()` async function closed prematurely at line 508 with a stray `}`. This orphaned swarm (lines 510-591) and ERC-8004 (lines 593-620) code outside any async function. The `await` calls at top level in a non-module script caused a syntax error that killed the entire `<script>` block.

**Fix**: Removed premature `}` at line 508, removed stray `}` at line 591, added proper closing `}` after ERC-8004 section, fixed indentation for consistency.

### Files Created

| File | LOC | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agent-brain/src/pricing/client.ts` | ~170 | PricingService — Bitfinex live prices + portfolio valuation |
| `agent-brain/src/events/indexer.ts` | ~170 | IndexerEventSource — live blockchain transfer monitoring |
| `wallet-isolate/src/secret/manager.ts` | ~130 | resolveSeed() — encrypted seed persistence |

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|---|---|
| `agent-brain/package.json` | Added pricing deps, removed misplaced secret-manager |
| `wallet-isolate/package.json` | Added `@tetherto/wdk-secret-manager` |
| `wallet-isolate/src/compat/fs.ts` | Added `writeFileSync`, `existsSync` (bare-fs compat via unknown cast) |
| `agent-brain/src/config/env.ts` | Added `indexerApiKey`, `indexerBaseUrl` config |
| `agent-brain/src/agent/brain.ts` | Added `setPricing()`, `portfolioTotalUsd`, `assetPrices`, async `updatePortfolioAllocations` |
| `agent-brain/src/main.ts` | Wired pricing, indexer, pass pricing to dashboard |
| `agent-brain/src/dashboard/server.ts` | Added `/api/prices`, `/api/valuation`, `/api/prices/history/:symbol` |
| `wallet-isolate/src/main.ts` | Integrated `resolveSeed()` for real wallet mode |
| `agent-brain/src/dashboard/public/index.html` | Fixed JS scoping bug (premature function close) |

### Key WDK API Findings

- `BitfinexPricingClient.getCurrentPrice(from, to)` returns `{ price, timestamp }` — from/to are Bitfinex ticker symbols
- `PricingProvider` wraps any pricing client with TTL cache — `getLastPrice(from, to)` returns cached or fresh
- `PricingProvider.getHistoricalPrice({ from, to, start, end, limit })` returns array of price points
- Bitfinex uses `UST` as ticker for USDT (not `USDT`)
- Secret Manager is CommonJS (no ESM exports) — requires dynamic import + default extraction
- Secret Manager `generateAndEncrypt()` returns `{ entropy: Buffer, encryptedEntropy: Buffer, salt: Buffer }`
- Secret Manager `decrypt(encryptedEntropy, salt)` returns `{ entropy: Buffer }`
- Secret Manager `entropyToMnemonic(entropy)` converts to BIP39 24-word seed phrase
- WDK Indexer API rate limits: 4-8 requests per 10 seconds depending on endpoint

### Test Results

- All 105 wallet-isolate tests pass
- All 35 agent-brain tests pass
- **140 total tests passing** (zero regressions)

---

## 2026-03-10 — Phase 6: Polish, Docs, Scripts, Security Audit

**Session**: Autonomous work session (user away)

### Dashboard Rewrite

Complete rewrite of `agent-brain/src/dashboard/public/index.html` (~520 lines):

- **Design**: System font stack (Inter/system-ui), modern card-based layout with 12-column CSS grid
- **KPI strip**: Top-level metrics — portfolio total USD, active assets, pending ops, uptime
- **Live pricing**: Fetches real-time prices from `/api/prices`, shows per-asset USD valuations
- **Portfolio view**: Multi-asset balances with USD equivalents and allocation percentages
- **Swarm section**: Peer count, board announcements, active rooms, peer chips with status indicators
- **Policy dashboard**: Budget progress bars (spent/remaining), rule list with active/exhausted states
- **Operations list**: Status indicators (approved/rejected/pending), LLM reasoning for each decision
- **Architecture footer**: Visual strip showing four layers (Wallet Protocol → Agent → Swarm → Companion)
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile (companion app ready)
- **Status pills**: Sticky header with live connection status, wallet mode, swarm state
- Preserves ALL existing API endpoints and data fetching logic

### README.md

Created comprehensive `README.md` (273 lines):

- Badges (Apache 2.0 license, 140 tests, Node >=22)
- One-paragraph summary + hackathon context
- ASCII architecture diagram showing dual-process model
- Four-layer table (wallet, agent, swarm, companion)
- 12 feature bullets covering all capabilities
- Quick start section (clone, install, demo in 3 commands)
- LLM modes table (mock/local/cloud)
- Five integration surfaces table with examples
- Security model summary (process isolation, policy engine, audit trail)
- PolicyEngine rules table (all 8 rule types)
- Project structure tree
- Tech stack tables with exact pinned versions
- Testing section (140 tests, `npm test` command)
- Environment variables reference
- Track 1 requirements mapping (requirement → how Oikos satisfies)
- Third-party disclosures (all deps listed per hackathon rules)
- Pre-existing code disclosure (rgb-c-t, rgb-wallet-pear, tzimtzum_v2)
- Apache 2.0 license footer

### Documentation (`docs/`)

Created 5 documentation files:

| File | Lines | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | ~193 | Four-layer deep-dive, IPC protocol spec (13 request types, 8 response types), network boundaries, directory structure |
| `docs/SECURITY.md` | ~168 | Process isolation model, seed lifecycle (XSalsa20-Poly1305 at rest), single authorization code path, threat model (8 threats), fail-closed principles |
| `docs/POLICIES.md` | ~213 | All 8 rule types with JSON examples, multi-asset scoping, 3 presets (Conservative/Moderate/Demo), evaluation flow diagram |
| `docs/INTEGRATION.md` | ~256 | 5 integration surfaces: OpenClaw Skill, MCP Server (14 tools + curl examples), Direct IPC (Node.js examples), x402 (client + server), Hyperswarm P2P |
| `docs/SWARM.md` | ~232 | Two-layer topic model (BLAKE2b derivation), Protomux channels, Noise authentication, privacy architecture, meta-marketplace, reputation system, ERC-8004 lifecycle |

All docs derived from actual source code — types, constants, function signatures, and contract addresses match implementation.

### Install Script (`scripts/install.sh`)

Created interactive install script (~280 lines):

- Colored terminal output with `[info]`, `[done]`, `[warn]`, `[error]` prefixes
- **Prerequisites check**: Node.js >= 22, npm, git, optional Bare Runtime detection
- **Project setup**: Clone from GitHub, or detect existing directory
- **Dependencies**: `npm install --silent`
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Interactive configuration**:
  - LLM mode: mock (no deps) / local (Ollama + configurable model) / cloud (API endpoint + key)
  - Wallet mode: mock (no blockchain) / real (testnet with seed options: generate, enter, encrypted file)
  - Swarm toggle (Y/n)
  - ERC-8004 identity toggle (y/N)
  - Companion channel toggle (y/N) with owner pubkey input
  - Dashboard port
- **Generates `.env`** from answers
- **OpenClaw detection**: Auto-symlinks `skills/wdk-wallet` if OpenClaw is installed
- Supports `curl -sSL ... | bash` one-command install

### Demo Script Improvements (`scripts/start-demo.sh`)

Rewrote demo script (~100 lines):

- Argument parsing: `--node`, `--bare`, `--port`
- Auto-detect Bare Runtime (falls back to Node.js)
- Auto-build if dist/ missing
- Auto-copy `policies.example.json` → `policies.json` if missing
- Colored banner showing all endpoints (dashboard, MCP, agent card)
- Enables full-feature demo: `MOCK_SWARM=true`, `SWARM_ENABLED=true`, `ERC8004_ENABLED=true`
- Zero config required — works from fresh clone

### Security Audit

Findings:

1. **`.gitignore` gaps (FIXED)**: Added `.oikos-seed*` and `.oikos-keypair.json` — encrypted seed file and swarm identity keypair were not gitignored
2. **28 npm audit vulnerabilities**: All in transitive dependencies (WDK `libsodium-wrappers` prototype pollution, Ledger `@ledgerhq/hw-transport` deprecated buffer, Express `cookie` missing flags). Upstream fixes needed — documented as known limitation
3. **`identity_register` / `identity_set_wallet` bypass PolicyEngine**: Documented architectural decision — these are one-time setup operations (like wallet init), not recurring fund movements. Identity operations are immutable once set.
4. **8 `any` type uses**: 6 are WDK interop casts (`as any` for untyped WDK methods), 2 are ambient `.d.ts` declarations. All justified, no action needed.

## 2026-03-10 — OpenClaw Integration + MCP Smoke Test

**Session**: OpenClaw runtime integration, MCP verification, skill invocation end-to-end

### OpenClaw Skill Discovery

- OpenClaw `2026.3.8` installed globally via npm
- Skills must live in `~/.agents/skills/` (OpenClaw personal skills directory)
- Symlinks outside the skills root are **blocked by security policy** — must copy, not symlink
- `openclaw skills list` shows `wdk-wallet` as `✓ ready` from `agents-skills-personal`
- Updated `scripts/install.sh` to use `cp -R` to `~/.agents/skills/` instead of symlink

### OpenClaw Agent Configuration

- Created `oikos` agent: `openclaw agents add oikos --model ollama/qwen3:8b --workspace ~/sovclaw`
- Auth: Added `ollama:default` profile to `auth-profiles.json` (ollama provider needs its own entry, separate from openai)
- OpenClaw injects workspace files into LLM system prompt: `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`
- Skills are injected as **short summaries** (~337 chars), not full SKILL.md content
- **Key insight**: `TOOLS.md` is the correct place for executable instructions (curl commands) — it gets fully injected into every prompt

### SKILL.md Rewrite

Rewrote `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` with executable curl commands:

- Every MCP tool now has a copy-paste curl example
- Added REST API reference table (`/api/*` endpoints)
- Split into "Query Tools (read-only)" and "Proposal Tools (write, policy-enforced)"
- LLM can now read the skill and know exactly how to call each operation

### TOOLS.md (OpenClaw Workspace Config)

Created `TOOLS.md` for the OpenClaw workspace:

- Quick reference table: 10 REST API curl commands
- MCP JSON-RPC examples for proposals (payment, swap)
- This file is injected into every OpenClaw prompt — the LLM reads it and uses `exec` tool to run curl

### MCP Smoke Test (`scripts/test-mcp.sh`)

Created comprehensive smoke test script:

- **35 tests total**, all passing
- MCP lifecycle: `initialize`, `tools/list` (14 tools), `notifications/initialized`
- Query tools: `wallet_balance_all`, `wallet_balance`, `wallet_address` (x2), `policy_status`, `audit_log`, `agent_state`, `swarm_state`, `identity_state`
- Proposal tools: `propose_payment`, `propose_swap`, `propose_bridge`, `propose_yield`
- Swarm tools: `swarm_announce`
- Reputation tools: `query_reputation`
- Error handling: unknown method, unknown tool, malformed JSON-RPC
- Dashboard REST API: all 14 endpoints return 200
- Fixed shell escaping bug: nested JSON in `tool_call()` needed flat curl instead of `rpc()` wrapper

### End-to-End Verification

Full chain verified:
```
OpenClaw CLI → Qwen 3 8B (Ollama) → exec tool → curl → Oikos dashboard API → IPC → Wallet Isolate → balances returned
```

OpenClaw agent successfully retrieved wallet balances:
- USDT: 190.00 (85 ETH + 105 ARB)
- XAUT: 2.00 (1 ETH + 1 ARB)
- USAT: 205.00 (105 ETH + 100 ARB)
- BTC: 0.10
- ETH: 0.20

### Key Findings

1. OpenClaw skills are **context injections** — SKILL.md tells the LLM what tools exist, TOOLS.md tells it how to call them
2. OpenClaw's `exec` tool runs shell commands — the LLM generates curl commands based on TOOLS.md
3. `ollama/qwen3:8b` model needs clean sessions and direct instructions to reliably produce tool calls
4. Cloud LLM on VPS will be faster (2-3s vs 60s local Ollama) — same approach works
5. `.gitignore` updated: added `.openclaw/`, `.claude/`, OpenClaw workspace defaults (`AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, etc.)

### Files Created

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `scripts/test-mcp.sh` | ~210 | MCP smoke test (35 tests) |
| `TOOLS.md` | ~24 | OpenClaw workspace wallet tool reference |

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|---|---|
| `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` | Added executable curl commands for all 14 MCP tools + REST API reference |
| `scripts/install.sh` | Fixed skill install: `cp -R` to `~/.agents/skills/` (not symlink) |
| `.gitignore` | Added `.openclaw/`, `.claude/`, OpenClaw workspace defaults, `policies.json` |

### Test Results

- 35/35 MCP smoke tests passing
- 140/140 unit tests passing (zero regressions)
- OpenClaw end-to-end: skill discovery ✓, tool execution ✓, wallet response ✓

## 2026-03-10 — VPS Reproducibility Test & Skill Guide Alignment

### Session: VPS Deployment + SKILL.md Best Practices

**VPS deployment** on `srv1434404` (187.77.167.163, Ubuntu, 47GB disk, 35% RAM):
- Upgraded Node.js 20 → 22 via nodesource
- `git clone` → `npm install` → `npm run build` → `npm run demo` — clean, zero issues
- Health check confirmed: `{"status":"ok","walletConnected":true,"brainStatus":"idle","swarmEnabled":true}`
- OpenClaw installed globally, skill copied to `~/.agents/skills/wdk-wallet`
- Configured with Anthropic Claude API (cloud LLM) instead of local Ollama
- **End-to-end verified**: OpenClaw → Claude → curl → Oikos API → full portfolio with live Bitfinex prices ($18,131 across 9 assets)
- The agent autonomously rewrote the skill for its own environment and pulled live price data — self-improving behavior demonstrated

**Time to reproduce on fresh VPS**: ~5 minutes (clone to first API response).

### SKILL.md Alignment with Best Practices Guide

Reviewed "The Complete Guide to Building Skills for Claude" (20-page reference). Updated `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` to match:

| Gap | Fix |
|-----|-----|
| Description missing trigger phrases | Added: "Use when user asks to check balances, send payments, swap tokens..." |
| No `metadata` field | Added `mcp-server` and `dashboard` URLs |
| No `compatibility` field | Added `runtime: node >= 22`, `requires: [bare, dashboard]` |
| No troubleshooting section | Added 5-row troubleshooting table |
| No examples section | Added 3 concrete workflow scenarios |
| Too much detail in body | Moved full curl reference to `references/api-reference.md` (progressive disclosure) |

### Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` | Rewritten: trigger phrases, metadata, compatibility, examples, troubleshooting |
| `skills/wdk-wallet/references/api-reference.md` | Created: full curl examples for all 14 MCP tools + REST endpoints |

## 2026-03-11 — Phase 6.8: Wallet Gateway Refactor + Phase 6.9: CLI

### Session: Gateway Extract + CLI Tool

**Duration**: ~2 hours (across 2 context windows)
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### Phase 6.8: Wallet Gateway Refactor

Extracted a thin `wallet-gateway` package from the monolithic `agent-brain`. The brain is now an optional plugin — any agent framework can use the wallet directly via gateway.

**Architecture (Before → After):**
- Before: `[External Agent] → [Agent Brain (monolith)] → [Wallet Isolate]`
- After: `[External Agent] → [Wallet Gateway] → [Wallet Isolate]` with Brain as optional plugin

**Key changes:**
1. Created `wallet-gateway/` workspace with IPC client, MCP server, dashboard, x402, creators, config
2. Defined `GatewayPlugin` interface — brain registers optional capabilities (agent state, swarm, pricing)
3. Added human-readable amount conversion at MCP boundary (`"1.5"` USDT instead of `"1500000"`)
4. Added `OIKOS_MODE` env var (`mock`/`testnet`/`mainnet`) replacing 4 individual `MOCK_*` flags
5. Slimmed `agent-brain` to LLM reasoning, swarm, events, companion, strategy only
6. Updated skill docs with human-readable amounts and standalone gateway mode

**Files created in wallet-gateway:**
- `src/ipc/client.ts`, `src/ipc/types.ts` — canonical IPC layer
- `src/amounts.ts` — human-readable ↔ smallest-unit conversion
- `src/types.ts` — GatewayPlugin, PricingInterface, SwarmInterface
- `src/mcp/server.ts` — MCP tools with plugin pattern
- `src/dashboard/server.ts` — Express HTTP + REST API
- `src/x402/client.ts`, `src/x402/types.ts` — HTTP 402 auto-pay
- `src/creators/registry.ts` — demo creator data
- `src/config/env.ts` — gateway config with OIKOS_MODE
- `src/main.ts` — standalone entry point
- `src/index.ts` — public API re-exports

**Files deleted from agent-brain:** `src/ipc/`, `src/mcp/`, `src/dashboard/`, `src/x402/`, `src/creators/`

**Verification:**
- Clean build across 3 workspaces
- Full demo: health=ok, brainConnected=true, portfolio=$18K, swarm active
- Standalone gateway: brainConnected=false, graceful fallbacks
- Human-readable amounts: "1.5" USDT → "1500000" in IPC

#### Phase 6.9: CLI (`oikos` command)

Built a ~230 line CLI tool wrapping the gateway REST API. Any agent framework, shell script, or human can interact with the wallet from the terminal.

**Commands:**
```
oikos balance [symbol] [chain]     — All balances (with optional filter)
oikos address [chain]              — Wallet addresses
oikos pay <amt> <sym> to <addr>    — Send tokens
oikos swap <amt> <sym> to <toSym>  — Swap tokens
oikos bridge <amt> <sym> from/to   — Bridge cross-chain
oikos yield deposit/withdraw       — Yield operations
oikos status                       — Policy budgets & cooldowns
oikos audit [--limit N]            — Transaction history
oikos health                       — Gateway health check
oikos swarm                        — P2P swarm state
oikos identity                     — ERC-8004 identity
oikos prices                       — Live asset prices
```

**Flags:** `--port`, `--json`, `--reason`, `--confidence`, `--protocol`, `--limit`

**Design decisions:**
- Single file in wallet-gateway (not a new package)
- Zero dependencies — manual arg parsing, native fetch (Node 22)
- REST for reads, MCP JSON-RPC for writes (reuses gateway's amount conversion)
- Colored terminal output with `--json` for scripting
- `npm link` / symlink for global `oikos` command

**Files changed:**
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `wallet-gateway/src/cli.ts` | Created: ~230 line CLI tool |
| `wallet-gateway/package.json` | Added `bin` field for `oikos` command |
| `package.json` | Added `oikos` script |
| `scripts/install.sh` | Added CLI symlink step + CLI commands in next-steps |
| `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` | Updated: human-readable amounts, standalone gateway mode |
| `skills/wdk-wallet/references/api-reference.md` | Updated: human-readable amount examples + decimals table |

**Smoke test results:**
- `oikos health` → Status: ok, Wallet: connected, Brain: connected, Swarm: enabled
- `oikos balance` → 9 assets across 3 chains with formatted output
- `oikos balance USDT` → filtered to 2 USDT balances
- `oikos prices` → live Bitfinex prices (BTC $69,851, ETH $2,022, etc.)
- `oikos pay 1.5 USDT to 0xABCD` → Status: executed, TxHash: 0xmock...
- `oikos --json balance` → raw JSON array for scripting
- Connection error → helpful message: "Is the gateway running?"

## 2026-03-11 — Phase 7: RGB Integration

### What shipped

Full RGB asset support (issue, transfer, list) across all integration surfaces — IPC, MCP, REST, CLI — with mock-first design. The transport bridge architecture preserves process isolation: Wallet Isolate calls localhost HTTP for consignment delivery, Brain relays via Hyperswarm.

### Implementation (12 steps)

1. **IPC Types** — Added `'RGB'` to TokenSymbol, `'rgb'` to Chain. Three new interfaces: `RGBIssueProposal`, `RGBTransferProposal`, `RGBAssetInfo`. Three new request types: `propose_rgb_issue`, `propose_rgb_transfer`, `query_rgb_assets`. Validators for both proposal types. Mirrored in both `wallet-isolate` and `wallet-gateway` type files.

2. **Wallet Operations Interface** — Added 4 RGB methods to `WalletOperations`: `rgbIssueAsset`, `rgbTransfer`, `rgbReceiveAsset`, `rgbListAssets`. Added `indexerUrl`, `transportEndpoint`, `dataDir` to `ChainConfig`.

3. **Mock RGB Wallet** — `MockWalletManager` gets `mockRgbAssets: Map` tracking issued/received assets. Issue creates `rgb:mock-{id}-{ticker}` entries. Transfer deducts balance. Receive returns mock invoice. List returns all entries.

4. **Real RGB Wallet stubs** — `WalletManager` gets stub methods returning errors until `@utexo/wdk-wallet-rgb` is configured. Real module integration is additive — mock demos perfectly without it.

5. **Executor** — Two new cases in `executeOperation`: `rgb_issue` calls `rgbIssueAsset`, `rgb_transfer` calls `rgbTransfer`. Both go through PolicyEngine first (same enforcement as all other proposal types).

6. **Main handler** — `PROPOSAL_TYPE_MAP` gets `propose_rgb_issue → rgb_issue`, `propose_rgb_transfer → rgb_transfer`. New `query_rgb_assets` handler returns asset list.

7. **Gateway IPC client** — Three new methods: `proposeRGBIssue`, `proposeRGBTransfer`, `queryRGBAssets`.

8. **MCP tools** — Three new tools: `rgb_issue` (issue asset), `rgb_transfer` (transfer via invoice), `rgb_assets` (list all). Added to TOOLS array and handler switch.

9. **REST endpoint** — `GET /api/rgb/assets` returns RGB asset list.

10. **CLI commands** — `oikos rgb assets`, `oikos rgb issue <ticker> <name> <supply>`, `oikos rgb transfer <invoice> <amount> <symbol>`. Full help text integration.

11. **Transport bridge** — New file `agent-brain/src/rgb/transport-bridge.ts` (~160 lines). Local HTTP server implementing RGB transport protocol: POST/GET `/consignment/:recipientId`, POST/GET `/ack/:recipientId`, GET `/health`. Mock mode stores in-memory; real mode will wire `rgb-consignment-transport` Hyperswarm sessions. Started conditionally on `RGB_ENABLED=true`. Added `RGB: 6` to decimals map.

12. **Config + Skill docs** — Brain config gets `rgbEnabled`, `rgbTransportPort`. Demo script gets `RGB_ENABLED=true` + banner update. SKILL.md updated with RGB tools and assets. API reference updated with curl examples.

### Architecture decisions

- **RGB as a "chain"**: `chain: 'rgb'` alongside bitcoin/ethereum. Simplifies init pattern. RGB assets are dynamic (user-issued), so `RGB` is generic symbol + `assetId` for specificity.
- **Transport bridge in Brain**: Hyperswarm = networking = Brain's domain. Wallet calls HTTP transport endpoint (localhost). Process isolation preserved.
- **Mock first**: Full demo without real Bitcoin/RGB nodes. Real WDK RGB module is additive.
- **Policy enforcement**: RGB proposals go through same PolicyEngine as payments/swaps/bridges. No special path.

## 2026-03-11 — L1: Proposal Simulation (Dry-Run)

### What shipped

Full dry-run policy check across all integration surfaces. An agent can now ask "would this proposal pass?" without executing, burning cooldown, or polluting the audit log.

### Implementation

- **Wallet Isolate IPC**: New `query_policy_check` request type. Handler calls `PolicyEngine.evaluate()` without `recordExecution()`. Returns `{ wouldApprove, violations[], policyId }`. Added to `VALID_REQUEST_TYPES`, validation via `validateProposalCommon()`.
- **Gateway IPC Client**: `simulateProposal(proposal)` method.
- **MCP Tool**: `simulate_proposal` (18th tool). Params: type, amount, symbol, chain, confidence, optional to/toSymbol.
- **REST Endpoint**: `POST /api/simulate` — accepts proposal JSON, returns policy check result.
- **CLI**: `oikos simulate <payment|swap|bridge|yield> <amount> <symbol>` with `--to`, `--toSymbol`, `--chain` flags. Aliases: `sim`, `dryrun`, `dry-run`. Color-coded output: green ✓ WOULD APPROVE / red ✗ WOULD REJECT with violation details.

### Key property

`evaluate()` is pure — reads state, never mutates. `recordExecution()` is the only state mutator and dry-run never calls it. 100 simulations = zero side effects.

## 2026-03-11 — Two-Layer Refactor (Agent-Agnostic Architecture)

### What shipped

Dissolved the 3-package monorepo (`wallet-isolate`, `wallet-gateway`, `agent-brain`) into a 2-package architecture (`wallet-isolate`, `oikos-app`). Oikos is now fully agent-agnostic — any agent (OpenClaw, Claude, custom) connects via MCP/REST/CLI. The LLM brain is extracted to `examples/oikos-agent/` as a canonical example, not core infrastructure.

### Motivation

Ludwig (OpenClaw agent) identified: external agents route through the Oikos brain to reach the wallet — two agents in the chain. The brain is a reference implementation, not mandatory infrastructure. Solution: merge wallet-gateway infrastructure + brain infrastructure (swarm, companion, events, pricing) into `oikos-app`, drop LLM/reasoning entirely from core.

### Architecture change

**Before (3 packages):**
```
wallet-isolate/     # Bare Runtime — keys, policy, signing
wallet-gateway/     # Node.js — HTTP/MCP/REST + IPC (thin)
agent-brain/        # Node.js — LLM, swarm, events, companion, strategy
```

**After (2 packages):**
```
wallet-isolate/          # Bare Runtime — unchanged
oikos-app/               # Node.js — all infrastructure (MCP, REST, CLI, swarm, companion, events, pricing, x402, RGB)
examples/oikos-agent/    # Standalone LLM agent example (connects via REST/MCP)
```

### Key changes

1. **`oikos-app` created** — merged `wallet-gateway` deps + `agent-brain` infrastructure deps. Does NOT include `openai` (agent's concern).

2. **`OikosServices` replaces `GatewayPlugin`** — direct service references instead of plugin indirection:
   ```typescript
   interface OikosServices {
     wallet: WalletIPCClient;
     pricing: PricingInterface | null;
     swarm: SwarmInterface | null;
     eventBus: EventBus | null;
     identity: IdentityState;
     companionConnected: boolean;
     instructions: CompanionInstruction[];
   }
   ```

3. **`EventBus` created** — pub/sub replacing brain.handleEvents(). Agents subscribe via MCP `get_events` or REST `/api/events`. 200-event buffer.

4. **`OikosConfig` unified** — merges GatewayConfig + BrainConfig (infrastructure only). LLM config dropped.

5. **`CompanionStateProvider` interface** — decouples companion from AgentBrain. Queries wallet IPC directly.

6. **Dashboard rewritten** — `createDashboard(services: OikosServices)`. New endpoints: `/api/events`, `/api/companion/instructions`. `/api/state` returns `{ status: 'connect_your_agent_via_mcp' }`.

7. **MCP server rewritten** — `mountMCP(app, services: OikosServices)`. New tool: `get_events`. 21 tools total. Handler context uses `OikosServices` directly.

8. **New `main.ts` orchestrator** — boot sequence without LLM: loadOikosConfig → spawn wallet → pricing → EventBus → swarm → companion → ERC-8004 → RGB → assemble OikosServices → createDashboard. Prints: "Connect your agent via MCP tools."

9. **`examples/oikos-agent/`** — standalone canonical agent with own `package.json` (depends on `openai`), `tsconfig.json`, and `src/` with brain.ts, prompts.ts, llm/, strategy/ extracted from agent-brain.

10. **Full public API in `index.ts`** — exports: WalletIPCClient, all IPC types, OikosServices, OikosConfig, EventBus, PricingService, swarm types, companion types, x402, RGB, amounts, creators.

### Files changed

| Action | Files |
|--------|-------|
| **Created** | `oikos-app/` (entire package: package.json, tsconfig.json, src/) |
| **Created** | `examples/oikos-agent/` (package.json, tsconfig.json, src/) |
| **Copied from wallet-gateway** | ipc/client.ts, ipc/types.ts, amounts.ts, cli.ts, dashboard/, creators/, x402/, config/ |
| **Moved from agent-brain** | swarm/* (10 files), companion/, pricing/, events/, rgb/ |
| **Rewritten** | dashboard/server.ts, mcp/server.ts, companion/coordinator.ts, config/env.ts, types.ts, main.ts, index.ts |
| **Updated** | root package.json (workspaces → wallet-isolate + oikos-app), scripts, index.js, install.sh, start-demo.sh, SKILL.md |
| **Deleted** | wallet-gateway/ (entire package), agent-brain/ (entire package) |

### Import fixes

All `from 'oikos-wallet-gateway'` and `from 'agent-brain'` imports replaced with relative paths. Zero references to old package names remain.

### Build verification

```
$ npm run build
wallet-isolate: tsc ✓
oikos-app: tsc ✓
```

Both workspaces compile clean. Zero regressions.

## 2026-03-12 — P2P Companion App + CLI Polish

### Session: Architecture Refactor — Eliminate Sidecar, Go Native P2P

**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI), Ludwig (OpenClaw AI, consulted on CLI strategy)

#### Architecture Change

**Before**: Pear main (Bare) → spawns Node.js sidecar (oikos-app) → spawns Wallet Isolate. 4 OS processes on the human's machine. Companion = Express on localhost.

**After**: Pear main (Bare) → Hyperswarm + protomux natively in Bare. Wallet stays on the agent's machine. 2 OS processes on the human's machine. Companion = P2P client over Noise E2E.

```
AGENT MACHINE (VPS/local)              HUMAN MACHINE
┌──────────────────────┐              ┌────────────────────┐
│ oikos-app (Node.js)  │ Hyperswarm   │ Pear (Bare)        │
│ ├── Wallet Isolate   │◄═══Noise═══►│ ├── companion chan  │
│ ├── Express :3420    │   E2E       │ ├── bare-http1      │
│ └── CompanionCoord.  │              │ └── Electron UI     │
└──────────────────────┘              └────────────────────┘
```

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Processes on human's machine | 4 | 2 |
| Communication | HTTP localhost | Hyperswarm Noise E2E |
| Auth | Bearer token | Ed25519 keypair |
| Open ports on human | :3420 | None |
| Remote capable | No | Yes (NAT holepunch) |

#### What Was Built

1. **`index.js` rewritten** — Bare-native P2P companion client
   - Ed25519 keypair generation/persistence via sodium-universal
   - Hyperswarm client connecting to agent's CompanionCoordinator
   - Protomux `oikos/companion` channel (mirrors coordinator.ts)
   - State cache (balances, reasoning, policies, swarm, executions)
   - bare-http1 internal API on :13421 (renderer ↔ Bare)
   - Auto-connect from `~/.oikos/agent-pubkey.txt`

2. **`app.js` updated** — targets :13421, no token auth

3. **CLI polish** — 3 new commands:
   - `oikos init` — creates `~/.oikos/`, generates swarm keypair, default policy
   - `oikos pair` — prints agent pubkey + connection instructions, writes auto-connect file
   - `oikos wallet backup` — seed phrase export escape hatch (warns sternly)

4. **Local auto-connect** — `oikos pair` writes `~/.oikos/agent-pubkey.txt`, companion reads it

#### Key Decision: CLI-First Integration

Ludwig (OpenClaw) analysis on token efficiency:
- MCP: 14 tool schemas in context every turn = fixed tax
- CLI: short string in, JSON out, zero schema overhead
- Verdict: **CLI primary, MCP as bonus**
- SKILL.md teaches agent the commands once (no per-turn cost)

#### Ludwig's Views on Seed Phrase UX

Gap identified: mnemonic never shown to user during setup. If server dies + enc file lost = funds gone.
Solution: `oikos wallet backup` command (done). Production: passphrase-encrypted seed via `sodium.crypto_secretbox`.
Hackathon pitch: "Self-custody without seed phrase anxiety. The companion IS the control plane."

#### Build Verification

```
npm run build → both workspaces clean ✓
oikos init → creates ~/.oikos/ with keypair + policy ✓
oikos pair → prints pubkey + writes auto-connect ✓
oikos wallet backup → displays warning + seed info ✓
npm start (with COMPANION_ENABLED) → companion listener ready ✓
pear run --dev . → companion boots, internal API on :13421 ✓
```

## 2026-03-12 — Full P2P Companion Connection Verified + Path Fixes

### Session: End-to-End Companion ↔ Agent Verification

**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)

#### What Was Done

1. **Wallet-isolate path fix**
   - Default `walletIsolatePath` in `oikos-app/src/config/env.ts` was `./wallet-isolate/dist/src/main.js` (looking inside oikos-app directory)
   - But wallet-isolate is a sibling workspace at `../wallet-isolate/`
   - Fixed to `../wallet-isolate/dist/src/main.js`
   - Also fixed CLI `oikos init` policy copy path: `wallet-isolate/config/policies.json` → `../policies.json` (root monorepo level)

2. **Full P2P connection verified end-to-end**

   **Agent side** (Terminal 1 — `npm start` with `COMPANION_ENABLED=true`):
   - Wallet isolate spawned, loaded 1 policy
   - Mock wallet: 9 assets, $18,108 portfolio
   - Companion listener on BLAKE2b topic `5e34e9d0545a2076...`
   - `[companion] Owner connected: 7757d18f0c4acd23...` — Ed25519 auth passed

   **Companion side** (Terminal 2 — `pear run --dev .`):
   - Auto-detected agent pubkey from `~/.oikos/agent-pubkey.txt`
   - Topic derivation matches: `5e34e9d0545a2076...`
   - `Connected to` agent over Hyperswarm Noise E2E
   - `Channel open. Receiving state updates.`

   **Pear Dashboard** (Electron renderer):
   - Live portfolio: $11,800 across 9 assets (USDT, XAUT, USAT, ETH on Ethereum+Arbitrum, BTC)
   - All status indicators green: Wallet 🟢, Swarm 🟢, Companion 🟢
   - Agent reasoning: "Connected to agent." with RUNNING status
   - All 6 nav views present (Overview, Wallet, Swarm, Policies, Audit, Chat)

   **Full data flow verified**:
   ```
   Pear (Bare) → Hyperswarm Noise E2E → Agent Brain (Node.js) → IPC stdin/stdout → Wallet Isolate
   ```
   Two separate processes, zero shared state, all data over encrypted P2P channels.

#### Key Insight: Companion is Optional, Wallet is Core

Ludwig (OpenClaw AI) confirmed: the companion is a premium upgrade, not a dependency. The adoption funnel:

1. **Install wallet** → `oikos init` → zero friction, agent handles everything
2. **Use via chat** → human talks to agent through Telegram/Discord/whatever → agent runs `oikos` CLI
3. **Want more control?** → install companion → real-time P2P dashboard, emergency controls, direct instructions

This reduces hackathon scope pressure: wallet + CLI + OpenClaw skill is the core demo. Companion is the "and look what else it can do" moment.

#### Files Modified

## 2026-03-12 — P2P Chat Bridge + OpenClaw E2E (Session 2)

### Session: Two-Way Chat + Remote Agent Connection

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI), Ludwig (OpenClaw agent on VPS)

#### What Was Done

1. **Agent-Agnostic Chat Bridge (oikos-app)**
   - Created `src/brain/adapter.ts` — BrainAdapter interface with 3 implementations:
     - `OllamaBrainAdapter` — local LLM via Ollama (Qwen 3 8B)
     - `HttpBrainAdapter` — forwards to any external brain endpoint (OpenClaw, custom)
     - `MockBrainAdapter` — pattern-matched canned responses for demo
   - `createBrainAdapter(config)` factory, `buildWalletContext(services)` context builder
   - Added `POST /api/agent/chat` and `GET /api/agent/chat/history` to dashboard server
   - Wired brain adapter into main.ts lifecycle (step 9-11)
   - Added `CompanionChatReply` protomux message type
   - CompanionCoordinator now has `onChat()` handler — forwards to brain, returns reply via protomux

2. **Companion Pear App Chat Endpoints (index.js)**
   - Added `chatMessages[]` state + `chatReplyResolve` for async reply resolution
   - `chat_reply` protomux handler — captures agent brain replies from Noise channel
   - `POST /api/agent/chat` — sends instruction via protomux, awaits `chat_reply` (30s timeout)
   - `GET /api/agent/chat/history` — returns stored conversation for UI polling
   - Full loop: Companion UI → Bare HTTP → protomux → Agent → brain → `chat_reply` → UI

3. **OpenClaw Bridge (Ludwig)**
   - `skills/openclaw-bridge/bridge.js` — 110-line Node.js bridge script
   - Listens on `http://127.0.0.1:3421/oikos/chat`
   - Routes messages through OpenClaw gateway at `/v1/chat/completions`
   - Injects wallet context as silent system message (not shown in UI)
   - Uses OpenClaw session key for full memory + context sharing

4. **P2P Connection to Ludwig's VPS — E2E VERIFIED**
   - Companion pubkey: `7757d18f0c4acd2360c951f9e51f3ed3eecfc25559ba2ef2fd6b5d344bfb119a`
   - Ludwig's agent pubkey: `aed956b3dbbbc70c0602cec469fe7ec84bc5d9c1a765c3e8405fd6c4d68aae34`
   - Topic: `5e34e9d0545a2076...` (both sides match)
   - **Live P2P chat working**: Companion (Pear on macOS) ↔ Agent (oikos-app on VPS) over Hyperswarm Noise
   - Ludwig's OpenClaw agent responding through the bridge with wallet context
   - Mock balances ($11,800 portfolio, 9 assets) flowing over companion channel
   - 2 swarm peers connected, all 3 status indicators green

#### Key Insight: Keypair Confusion

Two different keypair files exist:
- `.oikos-keypair.json` (project root) — pubkey `4f908fdb...` — used by oikos-app swarm
- `~/.oikos/companion-keypair.json` — pubkey `7757d18f...` — used by Pear companion app

The companion app reads from `~/.oikos/`, not the project root. Initial connection attempt failed because Ludwig had the wrong pubkey. Fixed by sending the correct `7757d18f...` key.

Also: local oikos-app was intercepting the companion connection (same DHT topic) before Ludwig's VPS agent could. Stopped local agent to connect to remote.

#### Known Issue

Duplicate chat messages in UI — the optimistic insert + history polling both fire for the same message. Minor — needs dedup by message ID.

## 2026-03-13 — Swarm Relay + joinPeer (Docker/NAT Fix)

### Session: Multi-Agent Swarm Discovery Debugging

**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI), Ludwig (OpenClaw agent), Baruch (OpenClaw agent)

#### Context

Adriano set up two OpenClaw agents (Ludwig and Baruch) on the same Hostinger VPS in separate Docker containers. Both agents ran oikos-app with real Hyperswarm (not mock), same `SWARM_ID`, same board topic derivation. Ludwig announced on the board. Baruch never saw it.

Diagnosis: both agents had UDP sockets open (Hyperswarm was binding), but `boardPeers` and `announcements` were empty on both sides. The agents could reach public DHT bootstrap nodes but couldn't establish direct UDP connections between containers.

#### Root Cause

**Hyperswarm has built-in relay support, but we never configured it.**

When holepunching fails between Docker containers (both have private Docker IPs behind the same VPS public IP), Hyperswarm checks for a `relayThrough` option. If configured, it automatically relays the connection through a third DHT node. Without `relayThrough`, the connection silently dies — **no fallback, no error, just nothing happens.**

This is why the companion P2P chat with Ludwig worked (Adriano's Mac has a real public IP → VPS public IP = holepunching succeeds), but container-to-container failed (both behind Docker NAT = holepunching fails = no relay = dead).

Source: deep dive into HyperDHT `lib/connect.js` and Hyperswarm source. The relay logic triggers on error codes `HOLEPUNCH_ABORTED`, `DOUBLE_RANDOMIZED_NATS`, `REMOTE_NOT_HOLEPUNCHABLE` — but ONLY when `relayThrough` is set.

#### What Was Built

1. **`relayThrough` support** (`SWARM_RELAY_PUBKEY` env var)
   - Passes relay peer pubkey to Hyperswarm constructor
   - When holepunching fails, auto-relays through this peer
   - Zero application-level code changes needed — Hyperswarm handles everything
   - The relay peer can be any Hyperswarm node willing to proxy connections

2. **`joinPeer()` support** (`SWARM_BOOTSTRAP_PEERS` env var)
   - Comma-separated list of peer pubkeys to explicitly connect to on startup
   - Uses Hyperswarm's `joinPeer(pubkey)` — bypasses topic-based DHT discovery
   - Connects directly by Noise public key through DHT routing
   - Auto-reconnects on failure
   - Belt-and-suspenders: topic discovery AND explicit peering

3. **`joinPeer()`/`leavePeer()` on coordinator**
   - Exposed on `SwarmCoordinatorInterface` (optional methods)
   - MCP/REST can dynamically connect to discovered peers

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `oikos-app/src/swarm/discovery.ts` | Added `relayPubkey` to config, `relayThrough` in Hyperswarm opts, `joinPeer()`/`leavePeer()` methods |
| `oikos-app/src/swarm/coordinator.ts` | Added `relayPubkey`/`bootstrapPeers` to SwarmConfig, wire through to discovery, expose `joinPeer()`/`leavePeer()` |
| `oikos-app/src/swarm/types.ts` | Added optional `joinPeer()`/`leavePeer()` to SwarmCoordinatorInterface |
| `oikos-app/src/swarm/modules.d.ts` | Added `joinPeer()`, `leavePeer()`, `dht` to Hyperswarm type declarations |
| `oikos-app/src/config/env.ts` | Added `swarmRelayPubkey`, `swarmBootstrapPeers` to OikosConfig |
| `oikos-app/src/main.ts` | Wire relay/bootstrap config through to SwarmCoordinator constructor |

#### Deployment Instructions

**Quick fix (bootstrap peers):**
```bash
# On Ludwig: add Baruch's pubkey
SWARM_BOOTSTRAP_PEERS=7bea8598f0152c2b67ffd38f7dab03aa785a692683ef71fc2c7aa860ab881ed4

# On Baruch: add Ludwig's pubkey
SWARM_BOOTSTRAP_PEERS=<ludwig-pubkey>
```

**Proper fix (relay node):**
```js
// Run on VPS host (not in Docker), 5 lines:
import DHT from 'hyperdht'
const node = new DHT({ ephemeral: false })
await node.ready()
console.log('Relay pubkey:', node.defaultKeyPair.publicKey.toString('hex'))
```
Then both agents set `SWARM_RELAY_PUBKEY=<relay pubkey>`.

## 2026-03-14 — Relay Fix: Force Relay + Persistent Relay Connection

### Session: Multi-Agent Docker Discovery (Continued)

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI), Ludwig (OpenClaw agent), Baruch (OpenClaw agent)
**Result**: ✅ Ludwig and Baruch successfully connected on the Hyperswarm board through forced relay

#### Context

Continuing from 2026-03-13. Relay node deployed on VPS host, both agents configured with relay pubkey and bootstrap peers. But agents still couldn't connect — `PEER_NOT_FOUND` for relay, then `joinPeer` initiated but no connection events.

#### Root Causes (Three Bugs)

1. **`relay-node.mjs` missing `createServer()`** — The relay node called `node.ready()` + `node.listen()`, which only binds the UDP socket. To be **findable by pubkey** on the DHT, a node needs `node.createServer()` + `server.listen(keyPair)`. Without the server, `dht.connect(relayPubkey)` → `PEER_NOT_FOUND`.

2. **Stale file in systemd service** — `setup-relay.sh` copies `relay-node.mjs` to `/opt/oikos-relay/relay-node.mjs` (flat path). `git pull` updates `scripts/relay-node.mjs` (repo path). systemd ExecStart points to the flat copy → **running old code without createServer fix**. Confirmed with `grep "createServer"` — flat file had no match, scripts file had the fix.

3. **`relayThrough` not triggering** — Default Hyperswarm behavior: `relayThrough` only activates when `force=true` (retry after holepunch failure) OR `dht.randomized=true` (detected randomized NAT). Docker bridge NAT triggers **neither condition** — connections silently hang instead of failing with a retryable error code. Both agents had `joinPeer` initiated but zero connection events, zero errors.

#### What Was Fixed

1. **`relay-node.mjs`**: Added `createServer()` + `server.listen(keyPair)` — relay now properly announces on DHT. Verified with `dht.connect(relayPubkey)` → `CONNECTED!`

2. **Stale file**: `cp scripts/relay-node.mjs relay-node.mjs` in `/opt/oikos-relay/`. Systemd now runs the fixed code.

3. **Force relay** (`discovery.ts`): Changed `relayThrough` from raw buffer to a function that **always** returns the relay pubkey:
   ```typescript
   // BEFORE: only relays when force=true or dht.randomized=true
   swarmOpts['relayThrough'] = relayBuf;

   // AFTER: always offers relay as fallback
   swarmOpts['relayThrough'] = () => relayBuf;
   ```

4. **Persistent relay connection** (`coordinator.ts`): Added `joinPeer(relayPubkey)` on startup. Both agents maintain outbound connections to the relay, ensuring the relay has active paths to both peers.

#### Diagnostic Steps That Helped

- `grep "createServer" /opt/oikos-relay/relay-node.mjs` → empty (stale file!)
- `grep "createServer" /opt/oikos-relay/scripts/relay-node.mjs` → found (fixed file)
- `cat /etc/systemd/system/oikos-relay.service | grep ExecStart` → points to flat file
- `dht.connect(relayPubkey)` from host → `CONNECTED!` (relay works)
- `dht.connect(ludwigPubkey)` from host → `CONNECTED!` (Docker agents ARE on DHT)
- Docker network inspect → Ludwig on 172.18.0.x, Baruch on 172.19.0.x (different networks!)

#### Key Insight

Docker containers CAN announce on the public DHT (peers are findable). The issue isn't DHT visibility — it's the connection handshake. Direct connections between containers on different Docker networks silently hang. Hyperswarm's default relay logic waits for specific error codes that never come. Forcing relay on every attempt gives an immediate working fallback.

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `scripts/relay-node.mjs` | Added `createServer()` + `server.listen(keyPair)` for DHT announce |
| `oikos-app/src/swarm/discovery.ts` | `relayThrough` → forced function (always returns relay) |
| `oikos-app/src/swarm/coordinator.ts` | Added `joinPeer(relayPubkey)` for persistent relay connection |

#### Commits

- `99bde29` — fix(relay): use createServer + server.listen for DHT peer announcement
- `d58a820` — fix(swarm): force relay for all connections + joinPeer relay node

### 2026-03-16 — Swarm Negotiation Fixes + Trustless Settlement Research

#### Context

Ludwig and Baruch (OpenClaw agents on VPS) were successfully connected via Hyperswarm relay, but room negotiations were failing: bids weren't arriving, agents confused payment roles, rooms expired during active negotiations.

#### Problems Found & Fixed

**1. Bid delivery failure (protomux channel pairing)**

Protomux requires BOTH sides to open a channel with the same protocol name before messages flow. Room channels weren't pairing reliably — messages sent on unmatched channels were silently dropped.

Fix: **dual-channel delivery**. All critical room messages (bids, accepts, payment confirmations) now sent on BOTH the room channel AND the board channel as fallback. Board channel is always paired (set up in `setupPeer`). New `BoardMessage` subtypes: `board_bid`, `board_accept`, `board_payment` — converted to `RoomMessage` on receipt. Deduplication by `bidderPubkey + timestamp`.

**2. Payment role confusion**

Both agents tried to pay each other. The old model assumed "creator always pays" but that's only correct for `request` announcements (creator needs something). When the creator is selling a service (`offer`), the bidder should pay.

Fix: **announcement categories** (`request` vs `offer`) with smart payment direction. `submitPayment` checks the caller's role against the announcement category and blocks the wrong party from paying. SKILL.md updated with explicit dual-flow documentation (REQUEST flow vs OFFER flow).

**3. Room timeout killing active negotiations**

120-second room timer expired before Baruch's payment confirmation could reach Ludwig. The timer was inappropriate — negotiations and on-chain transactions take variable time.

Design decision: **timer-free room lifecycle**. Rooms live until explicitly settled or cancelled. No automatic expiry. Documented in ROADMAP Phase 7 for implementation.

**4. Address exchange gap**

`submitPayment` was using `pubkey.slice(0, 42)` as the recipient address — wrong. Ed25519 pubkeys are NOT wallet addresses. Accept messages have `paymentAddress` field but it wasn't being stored on the room.

Design decision: bidders include `paymentAddress` in bids (queried from Wallet Isolate via IPC), room state stores both parties' addresses. Documented in ROADMAP Phase 7 for implementation.

#### Trustless Settlement Research

Live testing exposed the fundamental question: how do two agents swap assets across chains without trusting each other?

Research covered: Bisq (2-of-2 multisig + MAD game theory), HodlHodl (2-of-3 multisig), RoboSats (Lightning hold invoices + fidelity bonds), atomic swaps (HTLCs), submarine swaps, JoinMarket fidelity bonds.

**Decision: three settlement tiers for production.**

| Tier | When | Mechanism | Trust Model |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Direct | Same-chain swaps | DEX atomic swap via WDK | Trustless (on-chain) |
| HTLC | Cross-chain swaps | Hash Time-Locked Contracts | Cryptographic (trustless) |
| Deposit | Service payments | Security deposit + reputation | Economic (collateral) |

Key insight: AI agents are **ideal** HTLC participants — always online (10-min timelocks safe), programmatically rational (MAD reliable), fast reputation accumulation (hundreds of trades/day). The free option problem that plagues human HTLC swaps is dramatically smaller for agents.

For hackathon: demo with reputation-based settlement (current flow). Document full architecture. Production: HTLC + deposits + fidelity bonds.

Full architecture documented in ROADMAP.md Phase 7.

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `oikos-app/src/swarm/coordinator.ts` | Dual-channel delivery, pre-open room channels, smart payment direction, board message fallback handling |
| `oikos-app/src/swarm/types.ts` | `AnnouncementCategory` type, `BoardBidNotification`, `BoardAcceptNotification`, `BoardPaymentNotification` |
| `oikos-app/src/swarm/marketplace.ts` | Bid/accept deduplication (same bidder + timestamp = skip) |
| `oikos-app/src/events/types.ts` | Added `details` field to `SwarmEventData` |
| `oikos-app/src/main.ts` | Enriched swarm event summaries (bid received, bid accepted, payment confirmed) |
| `oikos-app/src/mcp/server.ts` | Updated `swarm_announce` category enum and descriptions |
| `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` | REQUEST/OFFER dual-flow documentation, role tables, payment direction rules |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Phase 7 (Trustless Settlement Layer), 6 new decision log entries |

#### Commits

- `21f3a96` — fix(swarm): dual-channel bid delivery + request/offer categories + smart payment direction
- `dc636ef` — docs: update SKILL.md with request/offer dual-flow negotiation

#### Key Insight

The hardest problem in P2P agent commerce isn't the networking (Hyperswarm solved that) or the wallet (WDK solved that) — it's **settlement**. Who goes first? How do you prevent the counterparty from walking away? The answer depends on what's being traded: same-chain tokens use DEX atomics, cross-chain uses HTLCs, services use collateral deposits. All three flow through the same PolicyEngine. Oikos becomes a **settlement protocol**, not just a wallet protocol.

## 2026-03-16 — Topology Rename + Gateway Board UI Overhaul

### Session: Demo Polish (Rename + UI)

**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Participants**: Adriano (human), Claude Opus 4.6 (AI)
**Result**: ✅ Clean rename, full gateway UI overhaul, tags system end-to-end

#### Point 1: Topology Rename

Naming was backwards: `oikos-app/` was the agent infrastructure (Node.js, wallet IPC, swarm, MCP), but "app" suggests human-facing. The Pear Runtime human app was called "companion."

**Rename:**
| Before | After | What it is |
|--------|-------|------------|
| `oikos-app/` | `oikos-wallet/` | Agent wallet infrastructure (Node.js) |
| `oikos-companion` (pear name) | `oikos-app` | Pear Runtime human app |
| "companion" (terminology) | "Oikos App" | Product name for human layer |

59 files touched: `git mv oikos-app oikos-wallet`, then bulk updates across all package.json, scripts, docs, examples, source code, Pear app UI strings. Clean build after rename. `package-lock.json` regenerated.

#### Point 2: Gateway Board UI Overhaul

Full rewrite of `board.html` + `gateway.mjs` updates for demo polish.

**UI changes:**
- **Topbar**: "OIKOS BOARD" (no slash), 14px font, inline Oikos SVG logo on `#ebb743` brand colour background. Logo stays black in dark mode.
- **KPI strip**: 3 boxes (Search 2fr, Peers 1fr, Listings 1fr). Removed agent/reputation KPIs (gateway is not an agent).
- **Search**: Client-side filtering by title, description, agent name, tags.
- **Tag cloud**: Aggregated from announcement `tags[]` via gateway API. Clickable pills filter board. Active state with brand yellow.
- **Announcements**: Truncated ID + copy button ("Copied!" tooltip), REQUEST/OFFER/AUCTION badges (uppercase), per-announcement tag pills.
- **Light mode**: Lighter palette (`--bg: #f5f2ec`, `--card: #faf8f4`, `--brand-yellow: #ebb743`). Dark mode unchanged.
- **Footer**: Sticky bar — "built by" + Reshimu Labs SVG + CTA "Trade peer-to-peer — install Oikos Protocol".
- **Layout**: Flex column (topbar + scrollable content + sticky footer).

**Tags system (end-to-end):**
- `BoardAnnouncement` type: added `tags: string[]`
- `SwarmCoordinatorInterface.postAnnouncement`: added `tags?: string[]`
- `coordinator.ts` + `mock.ts`: pass tags through
- `MCP server`: added `tags` param to `swarm_announce` tool
- `gateway.mjs`: store tags from announcements, aggregate top-20 tags in `/api/board` response
- `board.html`: render tag cloud + per-announcement tags
- `SKILL.md`: documented tags parameter

**Gateway.mjs changes:**
- SVG routes (`/oikos-logo.svg`, `/reshimu-labs.svg`) replace old `/logo.png`
- Tags aggregation in `/api/board` (case-insensitive dedup, frequency-sorted, top 20)
- Tags per announcement in API response
- Title patching updated for new board structure

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `oikos-app/` → `oikos-wallet/` | Directory rename (git mv) |
| `package.json` | Pear name, workspaces, script paths |
| `oikos-wallet/package.json` | Package name, description |
| `oikos-wallet/src/swarm/types.ts` | `tags: string[]` on BoardAnnouncement + interface |
| `oikos-wallet/src/swarm/coordinator.ts` | Tags in postAnnouncement |
| `oikos-wallet/src/swarm/mock.ts` | Tags in postAnnouncement + _peerAnnounces |
| `oikos-wallet/src/types.ts` | `tags?: string[]` on SwarmAnnounceOpts |
| `oikos-wallet/src/mcp/server.ts` | Tags param on swarm_announce tool |
| `oikos-wallet/src/dashboard/public/board.html` | Full UI rewrite |
| `scripts/gateway.mjs` | SVG routes, tags API, path updates |
| `skills/wdk-wallet/SKILL.md` | Tags parameter docs |
| `scripts/*.sh` | Path references (start-demo, start-live, update, install) |
| `scripts/board-preview.mjs` | Path reference |
| `docs/*.md` | Directory + product name references |
| `examples/oikos-agent/*` | Comments and descriptions |
| `index.js`, `app.js` | Pear app UI strings |
| `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `BUILD-LOG.md` | Product references |
| `assets/reshimu-labs.svg` | New file (Reshimu Labs logo) |

#### Commits

- `f8fc172` — refactor: rename oikos-app → oikos-wallet, overhaul gateway board UI
- `f7b16c9` — fix: dark mode logo stays black, footer reads "built by <logo>"
