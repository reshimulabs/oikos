/**
 * x402 Resource Server — Sell services behind HTTP 402 paywalls.
 *
 * Adds x402 payment middleware to the Brain's Express dashboard.
 * Agents can monetize their services (price feeds, analysis, strategy files)
 * by requiring x402 micropayments.
 *
 * Uses the hosted SemanticPay facilitator for verification + settlement.
 * The agent's wallet address receives payments.
 *
 * Chains: Plasma (eip155:9745) with USD₮0
 * Facilitator: https://x402.semanticpay.io/
 *
 * @security Revenue flows TO the wallet, not from it. No policy check needed
 * for receiving payments. The facilitator handles verification and settlement.
