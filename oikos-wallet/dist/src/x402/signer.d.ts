/**
 * IPC-Bridged EVM Signer for x402
 *
 * Implements the ClientEvmSigner interface from @x402/evm by proxying
 * all signing operations through the Wallet Isolate via IPC.
 *
 * This is the key architectural piece that preserves process isolation:
 * - The Brain (Node.js) runs the x402 client logic
 * - The Wallet Isolate (Bare Runtime) holds keys and signs
 * - Policy evaluation happens INSIDE the Wallet Isolate before signing
 *
 * @security The Brain NEVER sees private keys. It sends typed data to the
 * Wallet Isolate, which evaluates policy, signs if approved, and returns
 * only the signature.
