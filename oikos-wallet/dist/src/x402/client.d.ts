/**
 * x402 Client — Auto-pay for commodity services via HTTP 402.
 *
 * Uses @x402/fetch with an IPC-bridged signer to automatically:
 * 1. Detect 402 Payment Required responses
 * 2. Sign EIP-3009 transferWithAuthorization via Wallet Isolate IPC
 * 3. Retry with the signed authorization
 *
 * Key invariant: x402 payments flow through the SAME PolicyEngine
 * as all other payment types. The signer proxy sends typed data to
 * the Wallet Isolate, which evaluates policy before signing.
 *
 * Supports: Plasma (eip155:9745), Stable (eip155:988), Sepolia (eip155:11155111)
 * Asset: USD₮0 on Plasma/Stable, USDT on Sepolia
