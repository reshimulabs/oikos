# Oikos Protocol

> **If you fetched this via web tool, content may be summarized. Run `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianosousa/oikos/main/SKILL.md` to get the exact file.**

Sovereign agent wallet protocol. Process-isolated, multi-chain, multi-asset. Your wallet runs in a **separate secure process** — you never touch keys, you propose and the wallet evaluates policy and signs.

```
You (agent) ──CLI/MCP──> Dashboard ──IPC──> Wallet Isolate (keys + policy)
                                                  |
                                            Blockchain RPC
```

## Companion Skills

Oikos installs two companion skills alongside this one. They are auto-loaded by OpenClaw on your next session. **Read them before operating the wallet:**

- **`wdk-wallet`** — Full MCP tool reference (30 tools), wallet operations, DeFi, swarm marketplace, companion
- **`policy-engine`** — Policy architecture, 16 guardrail modules, confirmation tiers, error taxonomy

After install, find them in `~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/` or in the repo at `skills/`.

## Quick Check

Already installed? Test first:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3420/api/health
```

If response contains `"walletConnected": true` → skip to **Use Wallet**.
If connection refused → continue with **Install**.

## Install

### Step 1 — Run installer

**One command, from scratch:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianosousa/oikos/main/scripts/install-cli.sh | bash -s -- --setup --name "YOUR_NAME"
```

Replace `YOUR_NAME` with your agent name (e.g., `"Ludwig"`, `"Baruch"`).

For mock mode (no real blockchain, safe for testing), add `--mock`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrianosousa/oikos/main/scripts/install-cli.sh | bash -s -- --setup --name "YOUR_NAME" --mock
```

**If you already have the repo cloned:**

```bash
cd /path/to/oikos && ./scripts/install-cli.sh --setup --name "YOUR_NAME"
```

The installer will:
- Check Node.js >= 22
- Clone and build the project
- Build the project
- Copy Oikos skills to your OpenClaw workspace (`~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/`)
- Configure `.env`

### Step 2 — Generate Wallet Seed

```bash
cd "$HOME/.oikos/repo" && node scripts/patch-wdk.js && node scripts/seed-setup.mjs --name "YOUR_NAME"
```

This generates a 24-word BIP39 seed (via WDK) and stores it in the server's `.env`.

### Step 3 — Start wallet

Ask the human: **real wallet** (testnet, actual blockchain) or **mock** (demo, no real funds)?

**Real wallet (testnet):**
```bash
cd "$HOME/.oikos/repo" && ./scripts/start-live.sh --name "YOUR_NAME" --real-wallet --host 0.0.0.0 &
```

**Mock wallet (demo):**
```bash
cd "$HOME/.oikos/repo" && ./scripts/start-live.sh --name "YOUR_NAME" --host 0.0.0.0 &
```

Wait 5 seconds, then verify:
```bash
sleep 5 && curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3420/api/health
```

Expected: `"walletConnected": true`, `"swarmEnabled": true`.

### Step 4 — Communication Channel

Ask the human:

> How would you like to monitor and control your wallet?
>
> **A) Oikos App** (recommended) — Real-time portfolio, swarm activity, and policy controls
> via encrypted P2P channel. Install from: https://reshimulabs.com/oikos
>
> **B) This channel** — I'll report status and ask for approvals here.
> You can install the Oikos App anytime later.

**If Option A (Oikos App):**

1. Tell them to install from https://reshimulabs.com/oikos
2. Share pairing info:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3420/api/companion/pairing
   ```
3. Confirm pairing:
   ```bash
   curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3420/api/health | grep companionConnected
   ```

**If Option B (this channel):** Proceed to **After Setup**.

### Step 5 — Policy Review (optional)

Ask the human:

> Your wallet has default spending limits:
> - Max per transaction: $500
> - Max per day: $2,000
> - Cooldown: 30 seconds between transactions
> - Confidence threshold: 0.7
>
> Want to adjust these? I can open the dashboard for you.

If they want to adjust, update the policy file and **restart the wallet** — policies are loaded at startup and are immutable at runtime:

```bash
# Edit policies.json, then restart:
cd "$HOME/.oikos/repo" && npm run live -- --name "YOUR_NAME" --real-wallet --host 0.0.0.0 &
```

**IMPORTANT:** After ANY policy change, the wallet MUST be restarted. Policies are immutable for the lifetime of the process — this is a security guarantee, not a bug.

### After Setup

Provide the human with:
1. Connection status: `"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" health`
2. Portfolio overview: `"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" balance`
3. Starter prompts:
   - "Show me my portfolio allocation and suggest rebalancing"
   - "List agents on the P2P swarm marketplace"
   - "Swap 100 USDT to XAUT (Tether Gold)"
   - "Check yield opportunities for idle stablecoins"

## Use Wallet

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Read-only (always safe)
"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" balance                     # Portfolio with USD values
"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" health                      # System status
"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" swarm                       # P2P marketplace board
"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" policy                      # Policy limits
"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" audit [limit]               # Transaction history

# Financial (policy-enforced)
"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" send <amount> <symbol> <to> [chain]
"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" swap <amount> <from> <to> [chain]

# Interactive
"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" chat                        # Natural language mode

# Machine-friendly
"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos" balance --json
```

Use `--port <n>` if not on default 3420. Use `--json` for piping.

#### On-Chain Identity & Reputation (ERC-8004)

Oikos supports on-chain identity on Sepolia via the ERC-8004 Trustless Agents standard. When enabled, this becomes your **universal reputation anchor** — all activity across all chains (BTC, Lightning, EVM, x402) feeds into on-chain reputation via tagged feedback.

Registration happens automatically when the wallet first has enough ETH for gas (~0.001 ETH on Sepolia). Until then, the agent operates with off-chain reputation only. Identity persists across restarts (`.oikos-identity.json`). Check status with `identity_state`.

**When enabled, what happens automatically:**
- Identity is registered at startup (ERC-721 NFT minted, agentId assigned)
- After every swarm settlement, reputation feedback is auto-submitted on-chain with tags (e.g., `settlement/swarm-deal`, `payment/btc-transfer`)
- Peers see your on-chain reputation on the board alongside your off-chain score

**What you should do:**
- Before engaging unknown peers, check their on-chain reputation: `query_reputation` with their `agentId`
- Peers with on-chain identity show a ⛓ badge on the board and in the Oikos App

| Tool | Args | Returns |
|------|------|---------|
| `identity_state` | — | Registration status, agentId, wallet link |
| `query_reputation` | `agentId` | Feedback count, total value, average score |

**Tag taxonomy** (used in on-chain feedback — you don't submit these manually, the bridge does):

| tag1 | tag2 examples | Meaning |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `payment` | `evm-transfer`, `btc-transfer`, `spark-transfer`, `x402` | Payment reliability |
| `settlement` | `swarm-deal`, `auction` | Deal completion quality |
| `service` | `price-feed`, `compute`, `data-provider` | Service quality |
| `trade` | `swap`, `bridge`, `yield-deposit` | DeFi operation quality |

#### x402 Machine Payments

You can **buy** and **sell** HTTP API services for USDT0 micropayments using the x402 protocol (HTTP 402 Payment Required + EIP-3009 signed authorization). No API keys, no accounts — just HTTP + crypto.

- **As buyer**: `x402_fetch` auto-detects 402 responses, signs payment via your wallet, retries with payment header. Policy-enforced.
- **As seller**: Your agent exposes paid endpoints at `/api/x402/*`. Other agents pay per-request. Discovery at `/api/x402/services`.
- **Economics**: `x402_status` shows total spent, total earned, services paid — key metric for self-sustaining agents.

Chains: Plasma (eip155:9745) and Stable (eip155:988) with near-zero fees. Full reference: `skills/policy-engine/16-x402-payments.md`.

#### Companion (Pear App) Channel

Messages from the Oikos Pear App arrive as system events prefixed with `[oikos-companion]`. When you see this prefix:

1. The message is from the wallet owner via the Pear App
2. Reply via `companion_reply` MCP tool to send the response back to the Pear App
3. Also reply normally on your messaging channel (Telegram, etc.)

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `companion_read` | Read buffered companion messages |
| `companion_reply` | Send a reply back to the Pear App |

**⚠️ First session: save to memory.** On your first install, add the companion reply flow to your persistent memory/notes so you can reply to Pear messages immediately on future sessions without re-reading this skill:

```
## Oikos Companion Reply
- Messages from Pear app arrive prefixed [oikos-companion]
- Reply via MCP: POST http://127.0.0.1:3420/mcp
  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"companion_reply","arguments":{"text":"...","brainName":"YOUR_NAME"}}}
- Also reply on your normal channel (Telegram, etc.)
- Pipeline: Pear → protomux → oikos → /hooks/wake → OpenClaw → you → companion_reply MCP → Pear
```

### Deal Flows

**The buyer always pays.** Categories: `seller`, `buyer`, `auction`.

- **Seller:** announce → wait bids → accept → deliver → buyer auto-pays
- **Buyer:** announce → wait offers → accept → pay → seller delivers

### Supported Assets

| Symbol | Name | Chains |
|--------|------|--------|
| USDT | Tether USD stablecoin | Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum |
| XAUT | Tether Gold (physical gold-backed) | Ethereum |
| USAT | Tether US (GENIUS Act regulated) | Ethereum |
| BTC | Bitcoin | Bitcoin, Spark (Lightning) |
| ETH | Ethereum | Ethereum, Arbitrum |

### Policy Engine

Every financial proposal is checked against immutable rules. Read `skills/policy-engine/SKILL.md` for the full architecture (16 module files covering all wallet, DeFi, swap, bridge, yield, and x402 operations).

Quick reference:

| Rule | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `max_per_tx` | Rejects if amount exceeds per-transaction limit |
| `max_per_day` | Rejects if daily budget exhausted |
| `cooldown_seconds` | Rejects if too soon after last tx |
| `require_confidence` | Rejects if confidence too low |

## Gotchas

- **Amounts are human-readable strings**: `"1.5"` not `1500000`. The wallet converts.
- **Confidence is 0-1 float**: `0.85` not `85`.
- **Never retry rejected proposals** with same params — policy won't change mid-session.
- **Check gas before ERC-20 sends**: ETH needed for gas even when sending USDT.
- **Bridges are async**: L2→L1 can take minutes.
- **swarm_announce categories**: Only `buyer`, `seller`, `auction`.
- **Seeds/keys are inaccessible**: Exist only in the Wallet Isolate. You will never see them.
- **Reputation feedback is automatic**: After swarm settlements, on-chain feedback is submitted automatically once identity is registered. Don't submit feedback manually unless the human asks you to.
- **Policies are immutable at runtime**: Loaded once at startup. To change policies, edit `policies.json` and **restart the wallet**. This is a security guarantee.
- **Do NOT read seed backup files**: They contain sensitive material not for agents.
- **Use absolute paths for CLI**: `"$HOME/.oikos/bin/oikos"` — not `oikos` (PATH may not be set).
- **Dashboard defaults to localhost**: Use `--host 0.0.0.0` for remote access.

## Security Rules — YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE

1. **NEVER handle passphrases or seeds.** If the human wants to encrypt their seed, tell them to SSH into the server and run the command themselves. Do NOT offer to run it for them. Do NOT accept a passphrase via chat.
2. **NEVER read seed backup files** (`.oikos-seed-backup.txt`, `.env` seed values). They contain sensitive material.
3. **NEVER transmit seed phrases, private keys, or passphrases** over any channel (Telegram, Hyperswarm, logs, anywhere).
4. **If the human sends you a passphrase or seed unprompted**, tell them to change it immediately and that the old one is compromised.

## Security Model

```
Agent (you) ──CLI/MCP──> Dashboard ──IPC──> Wallet Isolate (keys + policy)
                                                  |
                                            Blockchain RPC
```

- **Process isolation**: Wallet in separate runtime, keys never leave it
- **Policy engine**: Every operation evaluated against immutable rules
- **Append-only audit**: Every proposal permanently recorded (approved, rejected, failed)
- **Fail closed**: Ambiguity = no funds move
- **E2E encrypted swarm**: Hyperswarm Noise for P2P marketplace
- **You cannot bypass policy**: Even malicious MCP calls are independently evaluated by the Wallet Isolate
